    "description": "The paper proposes a new model calibration strategy called Neighbor Aware CaLibration (NACL) that aims to improve the calibration of deep segmentation networks by considering the spatial relationship among neighboring pixels. The method is based on introducing equality constraints on the logit values, allowing more control over the calibration process. Experiments demonstrate the superior performance of NACL across various benchmarks without compromising discriminative power.",
