    "description": "The paper revisits and combines existing self-supervised pretraining methods to scale their performance in terms of data and model size, presenting several technical contributions to enhance training stability and speed. It introduces the DINOv2 models, pretrained on a large and curated dataset, which outperform existing general-purpose feature models, like OpenCLIP, on various computer vision benchmarks at image and pixel levels.",
