description: The paper discusses a novel method for Bayesian imaging for radio interferometry using score-based generative
  models as priors. The proposed approach uses optical images of galaxies to infer images of protoplanetary disks and demonstrates
  competitive results compared to state-of-the-art algorithms in radio interferometry.
type:
  value: empirical
  justification: The paper introduces a new method and validates it using real observational data from the DSHARP survey and
    other datasets.
  quote: In this work, we use score-based generative models [14, 15] as principled priors [16] to perform Bayesian inference
    for radio interferometric imaging... We test our pipeline on ALMA observations of 3 DSHARP protoplanetary disks [17] as
    first application of this method to radio interferometry data.
