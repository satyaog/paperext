description: This paper explores the stability and convergence analysis of the SUCPA (Semi Unsupervised Calibration through
  Prior Adaptation) algorithm. It addresses both theoretical dynamical systems properties and empirical validation through
  machine learning applications.
type:
  value: theoretical
  justification: The paper includes both theoretical analysis of the SUCPA algorithm's convergence properties and empirical
    validation using real-world datasets.
  quote: Numerical experiments on real-world application are performed to support the theoretical results by means of two
    different classification problems
