description: This paper introduces Tree Cross Attention (TCA) and ReTreever, with TCA being a scalable and token-efficient
  alternative to Cross Attention by organizing data in a tree structure and performing tree-based search during inference.
  ReTreever, leveraging TCA, shows significant improvements in token efficiency and performance across various tasks compared
  to established models like Perceiver IO.
type:
  value: Empirical Study
  justification: The paper is based on empirical results demonstrated through experiments on classification and uncertainty
    estimation tasks.
  quote: We evaluate across various classification and uncertainty prediction tasks, showing (1) TCA achieves performance
    comparable to Cross Attention while being significantly more token efficient and (2) ReTreever outperforms Perceiver IO
    while using the same number of tokens for inference.
