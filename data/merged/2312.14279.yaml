title:
  value: Characterizing and Classifying Developer Forum Posts with their Intentions
  justification: This title accurately reflects the core subject and purpose of the paper, which is to classify developer
    forum posts according to their intentions.
  quote: Characterizing and Classifying Developer Forum Posts with their Intentions
description: This paper proposes an intention detection framework to classify developer forum posts by their intentions (such
  as asking for help, sharing information, etc.) using a transformer-based pre-trained model. The proposed model significantly
  outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in classifying post intentions.
type:
  value: empirical
  justification: The paper describes an empirical study involving the collection and manual analysis of a dataset from developer
    forums, as well as the development and evaluation of a transformer-based model for intention classification.
  quote: '...we manually annotate the intentions of posts following a rigorous process according to the resulting taxonomy
    of technical forum post intentions. ... we propose an intention prediction framework for technical online posts.'
primary_research_field:
  name:
    value: Natural Language Processing
    justification: The paper focuses on classifying posts from online forums using transformer-based language models, a prominent
      method in NLP.
    quote: In the framework, we employ transformer-based pre-trained language models to generate embeddings for both title
      and description of posts.

    value: Text Classification
    justification: The core task in the paper is to classify developer forum posts according to their intentions, which falls
      under the category of text classification.
    quote: Our work is performed on a dataset of forum posts provided by our industrial partner that covers multiple developer
      communities (e.g., Stack Overflow, Discourse forums, etc.). Furthermore, we manually annotate the intentions of posts
      following a rigorous process according to the resulting taxonomy of technical forum post intentions. Based on the findings
      and insights from the qualitative study, we propose an intention prediction framework for technical online posts.

      We use the pooler output of the PTMs, which corresponds to the representation of the first token... As by fine-tuning
      this layer with our task, the quality of embedding may be improved for our downstream task.
