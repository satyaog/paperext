  quote: Toward Metrics for Differentiating Out-of-Distribution Sets
description: The paper addresses the challenge of classifying out-of-distribution (OOD) samples with confidence using Convolutional
  Neural Networks (CNNs). It proposes a method to differentiate OOD sets based on generalization errors and introduces three
  efficient metrics (Softmax-based Entropy, Coverage Ratio, and Coverage Distance) to select the most effective OOD sets for
  training well-generalized, calibrated CNN models. The effectiveness is demonstrated across various image and audio classification
  tasks.
type:
  value: Empirical Study
  justification: The paper involves conducting numerous empirical experiments to evaluate the proposed metrics and validate
    the effectiveness of OOD sets for training CNN models.

    quote: Vanilla CNNs, as uncalibrated classifiers, suffer from classifying out-of-distribution (OOD) samples nearly as
