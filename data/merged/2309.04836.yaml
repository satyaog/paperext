  value: Neural Semantic Surface Maps
  justification: 'The title precisely encapsulates the core method and contribution described in the paper: using neural networks
    to create semantic surface maps.'
  quote: We present an automated technique for computing a map between two genus-zero shapes, which matches semantically corresponding
    regions to one another.
description: This paper presents an automated method for computing semantic mappings between pairs of genus-zero 3D shapes,
  optimizing semantic correspondences using features distilled from pre-trained vision transformers (ViT).
type:
  value: empirical study
  justification: The paper describes empirical experiments to validate the proposed method, including quantitative and qualitative
    evaluations.
  quote: Through quantitative and qualitative experiments, we evaluate our ability to match upright object pairs with varying
    levels of isometry for objects from the same semantic class and across different ones.
