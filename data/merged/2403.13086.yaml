    (L-MAC).
description: This paper introduces Listenable Maps for Audio Classifiers (L-MAC), a posthoc interpretation method designed
  to generate listenable and faithful interpretations for pretrained audio classifiers. L-MAC employs a decoder that produces
  binary masks over the spectrogram of the original input audio. These masks identify relevant portions of the audio that
  influenced the classifier's decision. The decoder is trained using a loss function that promotes high classifier confidence
  for the masked-in audio and low probability for the masked-out portions. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate
  that L-MAC outperforms several existing methods, including gradient and masking-based techniques, in producing faithful
  and user-preferred interpretations.
type:
  value: empirical
  justification: The paper conducts experiments, user studies, and quantitative evaluations to demonstrate that L-MAC produces
    more faithful and listenable interpretations compared to existing methods.
  quote: Quantitative evaluations on both in-domain and out-of-domain data demonstrate that L-MAC consistently produces more
    faithful interpretations than several gradient and masking-based methodologies. Furthermore, a user study confirms that,
    on average, users prefer the interpretations generated by the proposed technique.

    justification: The CNN14 model is used as the pretrained classifier on which L-MAC is evaluated and trained.
    quote: In these experiments, we first train a CNN14 classifier (Kong et al., 2020) on the ESC-50 dataset (Piczak) augmented
      with WHAM! noise, to simulate real-world mixtures. The classifier is trained on folds 1, 2, and 3 and obtains 75% and
      78% classification accuracy on folds 5 and 4, respectively.
