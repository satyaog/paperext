  quote: 'Beyond the ML Model: Applying Safety Engineering Frameworks to Text-to-Image Development'
description: This paper examines the application of safety engineering frameworks, particularly Failure Mode and Effects Analysis
  (FMEA) and System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA), in assessing the social and ethical risks in the development and deployment
  of text-to-image (T2I) models. By using these frameworks, the authors identify potential failures and hazards in various
  stages of the T2I model life cycle, including data processing, model integration, and use by artists.
type:
  value: Empirical study
  justification: The paper presents empirical evidence from applying safety engineering frameworks to T2I models and analyzing
    real-world case studies with users and practitioners.
  quote: While we did not conduct a full STPA/FMEA analysis, this case study offers empirical evidence on how safety engineering
    frameworks could be translated to analyzing social and ethical risks.

    justification: The paper deals with the development and deployment of deep learning models, specifically text-to-image
      models.
    quote: 'In this work, we applied two well-established safety engineering frameworks (FMEA, STPA) to a case study involving
      text-to-image models at three stages of the ML product development pipeline: data processing, integration of a T2I model
      with other models, and use.'

    value: Model Safety
    justification: The focus of the paper is on applying safety frameworks to identify social and ethical risks in AI models,
      particularly text-to-image models.
    quote: By conducting this type of analysis on the process (and not the model itself), a practitioner can identify both
      known and novel failures (and their resulting harms) that can emerge from training data processing choices.
