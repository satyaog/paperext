  quote: 'ConceptGraphs: Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Graphs for Perception and Planning'
description: The paper proposes ConceptGraphs, a novel method to construct open-vocabulary and object-centric 3D scene graphs
  for robot perception and planning. It leverages 2D foundation models and fuses their outputs into 3D by multiview association
  to create a structured and semantically rich representation. The method allows robots to understand complex scenes, perform
  task planning, and handle abstract language queries without requiring large 3D datasets or model finetuning.
type:
  value: Empirical Study
  justification: The paper includes experiments and real-world trials with robots to validate the proposed method, which classifies
    it as an empirical study.
  quote: We implement and demonstrate ConceptGraphs on a number of real-world robotics tasks across wheeled and legged mobile
    robot platforms.

    quote: For robots to perform a wide variety of tasks, they require a 3D representation of the world that is semantically
      rich, yet compact and efficient for task-driven perception and planning.... In this work, we propose ConceptGraphs,
      an open-vocabulary graph-structured represen- tation for 3D scenes.
