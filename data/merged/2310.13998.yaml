  quote: Transductive Learning for Textual Few-Shot Classification in API-based Embedding Models
description: This paper explores the application of transductive learning for few-shot text classification using API-based
  embedding models. It introduces a transductive inference method relying on a Fisher-Rao-based loss and presents a benchmark
  of eight datasets involving multiclass classification in four different languages. Additionally, it contrasts the effectiveness
  of transductive approaches against traditional inductive methods.
type:
  value: empirical
  justification: The paper includes experiments with various models, datasets, and methods to highlight the effectiveness
    of the proposed transductive approach.
  quote: We evaluate our methods using eight backbone models, along with an episodic evaluation over 1,000 episodes, which
    demonstrate the superiority of transductive inference over the standard inductive setting.
