  "description": "This paper introduces TAAL (Test-time Augmentation for Active Learning), a novel semi-supervised active learning approach tailored for medical image segmentation. The method leverages cross-augmentation consistency to enhance model learning and optimize sample selection for annotation based on uncertainty measures from data transformations. The approach aims to improve performance in both fully-supervised and semi-supervised settings without relying on external modules or simple heuristics.",
