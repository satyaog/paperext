  "description": "This paper presents a novel framework that bridges logical reasoning and deep learning by generating interpretable and verifiable logical rules through differentiable learning without the need for pre-specified logical structures. The proposed methodology improves upon SATNet, a differentiable MaxSAT solver, by introducing a maximum equality specification method that decodes SATNet’s learned weights into human-readable logical rules. The framework also incorporates domain knowledge for enhanced reliability.",
