    of diffusion models.
  quote: Are Diffusion Models Vision-And-Language Reasoners?
description: This research investigates whether diffusion models can perform vision-and-language reasoning, using Stable Diffusion
  models to introduce DiffusionITM method for image-text matching. The study also proposes GDBench, a benchmark for seven
  complex vision-and-language tasks and bias evaluation.

  value: empirical study
