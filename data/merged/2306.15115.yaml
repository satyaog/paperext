  value: Energy Sufficiency in Unknown Environments via Control Barrier Functions
  justification: The title is directly extracted from the paper and succinctly encapsulates the main theme of the research,
    which is to ensure energy sufficiency in unknown environments using Control Barrier Functions.
  quote: Energy Sufficiency in Unknown Environments via Control Barrier Functions
description: The paper presents a framework based on Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to ensure energy sufficiency of robots
  navigating unknown and unstructured environments. The framework can be integrated with various path planners, including
  those used for exploration missions. It guarantees that robots will not run out of energy during their missions, validated
  through both simulation and real-world experiments.
type:
  value: empirical
  justification: The paper involves simulation experiments and real-world tests on robots to validate the proposed energy
    sufficiency framework, which aligns with the characteristics of empirical research.
  quote: The framework is validated through physics-based simulation and on a physical AgileX Scout Mini rover.
