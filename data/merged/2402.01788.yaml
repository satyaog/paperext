  quote: 'LitLLM: A Toolkit for Scientific Literature Review'
description: The paper introduces LitLLM, a toolkit designed to assist researchers in conducting literature reviews using
  Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) principles. The system leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for summarizing abstracts,
  retrieving and re-ranking relevant papers, and generating related work sections, aiming to reduce the time and effort required
  for literature reviews.
type:
  value: empirical
  justification: The paper presents a system, LitLLM, and provides implementation details, as well as user experiences and
    usage studies, indicating its empirical nature.
  quote: "As a preliminary study, we provided access to our user interface to 5 different researchers who worked through the\
    \ demo to write literature reviews and validate the system\u2019s efficacy."

  name:
    value: Literature Review
    justification: The paper focuses on the use of LLMs and RAG techniques, which are core topics in the field of Natural
      Language Processing.
    quote: Following recent advances in large language models (LLMs), a new set of systems provides even more advanced features.

- name:
    value: Automated Literature Review
    justification: The primary focus of the paper is on automating the literature review process using AI and NLP techniques.
    quote: Conducting literature reviews for scientific papers is essential for understanding research, its limitations, and
      building on existing work. It is a tedious task which makes an automatic literature review generator appealing.
