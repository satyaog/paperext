  quote: Efficient Graph Generation with Graph Recurrent Attention Networks
description: The paper proposes a new family of efficient and expressive deep generative models for graphs, called Graph Recurrent
  Attention Networks (GRANs). The model generates graphs by creating blocks of nodes and associated edges at each step, using
  a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with attention to better capture dependencies in the graph structure. The model is evaluated
  on several benchmark datasets, showing state-of-the-art performance in terms of both efficiency and sample quality.
type:
  value: Empirical Study
  justification: The paper involves experiments on benchmark datasets (Grid, Protein, Point Cloud) to evaluate the proposed
    GRAN model, focusing on its efficiency and sample quality.
  quote: In this section we empirically verify the effectiveness of our model on both synthetic and real graph datasets with
    drastically varying sizes and characteristics.
