    models'
description: This paper introduces FoMo-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark for forest monitoring, integrating multiple
  remote sensing datasets and modalities. It also proposes the novel dataset TalloS for tree species classification and the
  foundation model FoMo-Net designed for multi-modal and multi-task remote sensing applications.
type:
  value: Empirical Study
  justification: The paper presents real-world datasets and experimental results to evaluate the proposed benchmark and model,
    which characterizes it as an empirical study.
  quote: To further enhance the diversity of tasks and geographies represented in FoMo-Bench, we introduce a novel global
    dataset, TalloS, combining satellite imagery with ground-based annotations for tree species classification... Finally,
    we propose FoMo-Net, a baseline foundation model with the capacity to process any combination of commonly used spectral
    bands in remote sensing, across diverse ground sampling distances and geographical locations worldwide.
