  quote: Prediction and Control in Continual Reinforcement Learning
description: 'The paper focuses on value function estimation in continual reinforcement learning. It proposes decomposing
  the value function into two components updated at different timescales: a permanent value function (learning general knowledge)
  and a transient value function (for quick adaptation). Empirical studies show the approach improves performance on prediction
  and control tasks.'
type:
  value: Empirical study
  justification: The paper includes empirical case studies and experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed
    method in different environments.

    value: Continual Reinforcement Learning
    justification: The paper specifically focuses on continual learning in reinforcement learning environments.
    quote: "Let S be the set of possible states and A the set of actions. At each timestep t, the agent takes action At \u2208\
      \ A in state St according to its (stochastic) policy \u03C0... This quantity can be estimated with a function approximator\
      \ parameterized by w, for example using TD learning."
