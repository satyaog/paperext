  quote: Bootstrapping Adaptive Human-Machine Interfaces with Offline Reinforcement Learning
description: The paper presents an offline reinforcement learning algorithm, ORBIT (Offline RL-Bootstrapped InTerface), which
  optimizes human-machine interfaces for sequential decision-making tasks like robotic teleoperation. The method combines
  offline pre-training with online fine-tuning to improve the interface's performance, particularly in noisy and high-dimensional
  command settings such as eye-gaze-based control.
type:
  value: empirical
  justification: The research includes user studies with participants performing tasks using the proposed ORBIT method and
    compares the performance with baseline methods.
  quote: "To evaluate ORBIT\u2019s ability to learn an effective interface from real user data, we conduct a user study with\
    \ 12 participants who perform a simulated navigation task by using their eye gaze to modulate a 128dimensional command\
    \ signal from their webcam (illustrated in Fig. 3 and 5)."

    value: Reinforcement Learning
    justification: The paper introduces a reinforcement learning algorithm and discusses its application and evaluation in
      sequential decision-making tasks.
    quote: Recent work on human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning ... lifts these assumptions, but still assumes access to
      either a task-agnostic reward function, task distribution, or prior interface.

    justification: The research focuses on interaction with users, especially using their feedback and commands to improve
      the learning algorithm.
    quote: "To address the high cost of user data, we pre-train value functions on a large offline dataset, and distill them\
      \ into a policy (i.e., an interface) that infers the user\u2019s desired action from the user\u2019s command signal."
