  quote: A Reduction from Reinforcement Learning to No-Regret Online Learning
description: 'The paper presents a reduction methodology from reinforcement learning (RL) to no-regret online learning using
  the saddle-point formulation of RL. This approach decomposes the RL problem into two parts: regret minimization and function
  approximation. By applying this reduction, new RL algorithms can be systematically designed. The paper also proposes an
  RL algorithm based on mirror descent and the generative-model oracle, providing provable performance guarantees.'
type:
  value: empirical
  justification: The paper proposes a new algorithm for RL and demonstrates its performance through empirical evaluation.
  quote: We demonstrate this idea by devising a simple RL algorithm based on mirror descent and the generative-model oracle.

    quote: In this work, we revisit the classic linear-program (LP) formulation of RL [1, 2] in an attempt to tackle this  long-standing
      question. We focus on the associated saddle-point problem of the LP (given by Lagrange duality).
