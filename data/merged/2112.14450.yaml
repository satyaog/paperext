  quote: Damping signatures at JUNO, a medium-baseline reactor neutrino oscillation experiment
description: This paper presents a study on the detection of damping signatures from new physics models at the Jiangmen Underground
  Neutrino Observatory (JUNO). The focus is on exponential damping factors in neutrino oscillation probabilities, induced
  by models such as quantum decoherence, neutrino decay, neutrino absorption, and wave packet decoherence. The authors analyze
  how well JUNO can constrain these damping parameters and differentiate the various models.
