  quote: Towards contrast-agnostic soft segmentation of the spinal cord
description: The paper presents a method for contrast-agnostic soft segmentation of the spinal cord using MRI images. The
  method leverages a dataset consisting of multiple contrasts and introduces a novel pipeline for generating soft ground truth
  segmented images. This pipeline includes preprocessing of data, dataset augmentation, and a unique loss function centered
  around regression (specifically, adaptive wing loss). The proposed model is tested against state-of-the-art methods and
  demonstrates superior performance in reducing cross-sectional area (CSA) variability across different contrasts and shows
  remarkable generalization capabilities to unseen data, including images with various spinal pathologies.

    quote: Using the Spine Generic Public Database of healthy participants (n = 267; contrasts = 6), we first generated participant-wise
      soft ground truth (GT) by averaging the binary segmentations across all 6 contrasts. These soft GT, along with aggressive
      data augmentation and a regression-based loss function, were then used to train a UNet model for spinal cord segmentation.
