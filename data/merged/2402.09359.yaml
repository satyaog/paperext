  quote: Pruning Sparse Tensor Neural Networks Enables Deep Learning for 3D Ultrasound Localization Microscopy
description: This paper explores the use of Sparse Tensor Neural Networks to reduce memory usage and improve the performance
  of deep learning models for 3D Ultrasound Localization Microscopy (ULM). Several approaches to efficiently convert ultrasound
  data into a sparse format are examined, along with the impacts on performance and memory requirements. The study shows that
  sparse formulations can significantly reduce memory costs and enable effective scaling of ULM from 2D to 3D, even with high
  concentrations of microbubbles.
