  "description": "The paper introduces SEVN, a sidewalk simulation environment, and a neural network-based approach for creating navigation agents for the visually impaired. It addresses the inadequacies of existing reinforcement learning environments for sidewalk navigation and proposes a multi-modal observation method to improve navigation. The paper also provides a dataset and experimental results to spark further research in assistive navigation for the visually impaired.",

    "quote": "This work introduces SEVN, a sidewalk simulation environment and a neural network-based approach to creating a navigation agent. SEVN contains panoramic images with labels for house numbers, doors, and street name signs, and formulations for several navigation tasks. We study the performance of an RL algorithm (PPO) in this setting."
