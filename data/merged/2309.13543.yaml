  quote: Substituting Data Annotation with Balanced Updates and Collective Loss in Multi-Label Text Classification
description: The paper presents a framework, Balanced Neighbourhoods and Collective Loss (BNCL), for multi-label text classification
  (MLTC) in settings with either no annotations or limited annotations. The approach maps input text to label likelihoods
  using a pre-trained language model, updates these likelihoods based on a label dependency graph, and applies collective
  loss to refine predictions.
type:
  value: empirical
  justification: The paper involves conducting multiple experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed BNCL
    framework across different datasets and comparing it against several baseline methods.
  quote: The experiments show that the proposed framework achieves effective performance under low supervision settings
