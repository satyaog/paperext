description: The paper introduces Swarm-SLAM, a decentralized, flexible, and scalable Collaborative Simultaneous Localization
  And Mapping (C-SLAM) system designed for multi-robot systems. The system supports various sensors and includes a novel inter-robot
  loop closure prioritization technique to enhance communication efficiency and reduce resource usage.

      [16] based on the RCBD solver.
