  quote: Improving Robustness and Reliability in Medical Image Classification with Latent-Guided Diffusion and Nested-Ensembles
description: This paper introduces a three-stage approach integrating transformers and conditional diffusion models to improve
  model robustness in medical image classification. It includes learning hierarchical feature representations, a reverse diffusion
  process guided by latent code to propose prediction candidates, and a bilevel aggregation protocol for final output.
