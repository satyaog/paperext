  quote: Non-minimal Lorentz invariance violation in light of muon anomalous magnetic moment and long-baseline neutrino oscillation
    data
description: The paper investigates the possibility of Lorentz invariance violation as a potential explanation for the recent
  tension observed in long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments, specifically T2K and NOvA. The study explores both isotropic
  and non-isotropic Lorentz invariance violations in dimensions D = 4, 5, and 6, and examines their effects on neutrino oscillation
  data and the anomalous muon magnetic moment.
type:
  value: empirical
  justification: The study is based on empirical data from neutrino oscillation experiments T2K and NOvA, as well as muon
    g-2 measurements.
  quote: "In light of the increasing hints of new physics at the muon g \u2212 2 and neutrino oscillation experiments, we\
    \ consider the recently observed tension in the long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments as a potential indication\
    \ of Lorentz invariance violation. For this purpose, the latest data from T2K and NOvA is analysed..."
