  quote: Differentiable Visual Computing for Inverse Problems and Machine Learning
description: This paper explores the emergent field of differentiable visual computing, which aims to merge the precision
  of visual computing methods (geometry processing, animation, and rendering) with the adaptive, data-efficient capabilities
  of deep learning. The study presents a systematic vision for a unified pipeline that facilitates the differentiable computation
  of gradients across these visual computing domains, enhancing their performance in solving complex real-world problems.
type:
  value: theoretical study
  justification: The paper provides a conceptual and theoretical framework for differentiable visual computing, rather than
    conducting empirical experiments.
  quote: We survey this growing body of work and propose a holistic and unified differentiable visual computing pipeline.
