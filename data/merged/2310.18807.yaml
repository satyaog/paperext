  quote: 'OC-NMN: Object-centric Compositional Neural Module Network for Generative Visual Analogical Reasoning'
description: This paper introduces an object-centric compositional neural module network (OC-NMN) designed for visual generative
  reasoning tasks. The model decomposes tasks into a series of primitives applied to objects using modularity. This approach
  aims to improve out-of-distribution generalization by leveraging neural templates composed of neural modules. The proposed
  method is evaluated using a new benchmark, Arith-MNIST, which involves arithmetic operations on visual digits.
type:
  value: empirical
  justification: The paper presents experimental results from applying the proposed model to a new benchmark dataset called
    Arith-MNIST and compares it to existing baselines.
  quote: Using this benchmark, we evaluate the systematic compositional generalization of models on a set of controlled and
    easily extendable axes and show the benefits of object-centric inductive biases.
