  quote: Improving day-ahead Solar Irradiance Time Series Forecasting by Leveraging Spatio-Temporal Context
description: This paper proposes a deep learning architecture called CrossViViT for leveraging spatio-temporal context using
  satellite data to achieve highly accurate day-ahead time-series forecasting of Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI). It also
  introduces a novel multi-modal dataset that combines satellite imagery with solar irradiance and other physical variables.
type:
  value: empirical
  justification: The paper presents a new deep learning architecture and evaluates its performance using a novel dataset,
    thus focusing on experimental results and empirical validation.
  quote: In this paper, we put forth a deep learning architecture designed to harness spatio-temporal context using satellite
    data, to attain highly accurate day-ahead time-series forecasting for any given station, with a particular emphasis on
    forecasting Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI).
