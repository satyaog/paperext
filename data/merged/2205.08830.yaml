  quote: Prospects for Detecting the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background with JUNO
description: The paper discusses the potential of detecting the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB) at the Jiangmen
  Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) through the inverse-beta-decay (IBD) detection channel on free protons. Using the
  latest DSNB flux predictions, the study evaluates background suppression and optimization techniques aiming to achieve significant
  detection sensitivity.
type:
  value: empirical
  justification: The paper involves experimental setups, simulations, and evaluations based on empirical data and model predictions
    for DSNB detection.
  quote: "The DSNB signal calculation depends on a variety of important ingredients [24\u201326]. The first one is the cosmological\
    \ SN rate as a function of the progenitor mass and redshift, which is the link to the cosmic history of the star formation.\
    \ The second ingredient is the average energy spectrum of SN neutrinos. According to the latest large-scale SN numerical\
    \ simulation [25, 26], there are more astrophysical or physical effects which may alter the DSNB"
