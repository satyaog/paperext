title:
  value: Antagonistic AI
  justification: The title is a clear and concise representation of the paper's subject, which revolves around the concept
    of 'Antagonistic AI.'
  quote: In this provocation, we herald the shadow of the sycophantic paradigm, a design space we call antagonistic AI.
description: 'The paper explores the concept of ''Antagonistic AI,'' a design space for AI systems that act contrary to the
  norms embedded in contemporary commercial large language models (LLMs). These systems are intentionally disagreeable, confrontational,
  and dismissive. The researchers examine the potential value of these AI systems, such as building resilience, fostering
  critical thinking, and offering entertainment. Moreover, they emphasize the ethical dimensions for responsible design: consent,
  context, and framing.'
type:
  value: theoretical study
  justification: The paper is primarily focused on presenting a new concept and a design space for 'Antagonistic AI,' alongside
    theoretical discussions on its implications, benefits, and ethical dimensions.
  quote: Our argument proceeds as follows. We first briefly characterize the present-day AI paradigm...

    justification: The paper delves into the ethical considerations and human-computer interaction aspects of designing AI
      systems that are not conforming to current 'moral' standards, making it relevant to AI Ethics and HCI.
    quote: Our work is only a starting point, intending to spark tough conversations in the community about what 'safety',
      'harmlessness', and 'morality' really mean...

    justification: GPT-4 is used as an example of contemporary commercial LLMs that the notion of 'Antagonistic AI' contrasts
      against.
    quote: Interactions also showed potential to weaken our attachment to our ideas and ego, transcending self-defensiveness.
      For example, another author experienced significant insights and improvements in brainstorming with the Debbie Downer
      system, and they continue to use it regularly in their work.

      and harmful effects.
