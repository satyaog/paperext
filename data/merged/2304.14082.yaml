  quote: This work introduces JaxPruner, a JAX-based sparsity library for machine learning research.
description: This paper introduces JaxPruner, a JAX-based sparsity library designed to facilitate research in sparse neural
  networks through concise implementations of popular pruning and sparse training algorithms. It aims at minimal memory and
  latency overhead, ease of integration, and providing strong baselines.
type:
  value: empirical
  justification: The paper includes empirical benchmark results of JaxPruner on multiple standard datasets and demonstrates
    the utility of the library through various experiments.
  quote: We benchmark pruning and sparse training algorithms in 4 different domains and discuss them in subsequent sections

    value: Model Compression
    justification: The paper specifically addresses sparsity in neural networks, which is a sub-field within model compression
      and training efficiency.
    quote: 'There are two high-level strategies for achieving parameter sparsity: (1) pruning which aims to obtain sparse
      networks starting from dense networks for inference efficiency and (2) sparse training which aims to train sparse networks
      from scratch, thus reducing training cost as well.'
