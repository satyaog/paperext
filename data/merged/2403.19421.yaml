  quote: Scaling up ridge regression for brain encoding in a massive individual fMRI dataset
description: The paper evaluates various parallelization techniques to improve the training time of ridge regression for brain
  encoding using the CNeuroMod Friends dataset. It compares multi-threading, using libraries like Intel MKL and OpenBLAS,
  and distributed computing with Dask, proposing a new Batch-MultiOutput approach that showed significant speed-ups across
  multiple compute nodes and threads.
