title:
  value: A Study of Human-Robot Handover through Human-Human Object Transfer
  justification: This title accurately represents the paper's content, focusing on human-robot handover through human-human
    object transfer.
  quote: A Study of Human-Robot Handover through Human-Human Object Transfer
description: This paper investigates the differences in handover behavior when humans transfer hazardous objects versus safe
  objects using a high-resolution touch sensor. It highlights how these findings can inform safer human-robot interactions.
type:
  value: empirical
  justification: The paper involves conducting experiments to observe handover behavior, making it an empirical study.
  quote: we propose a methodology to study human-human handover using a haptic hand-held tactile device.
primary_research_field:
  name:
    value: Human-Computer Interaction
    justification: The paper focuses on understanding human-robot interactions, which is a core area in the field of Human-Computer
      Interaction.
    quote: In this paper, we consider the exchange of objects between humans and robots, as well as the contextual factors
      that modulate this behaviour.

    value: Haptics and Tactile Interaction
    justification: The paper emphasizes the role of tactile feedback in handover interactions, making it fall under the sub-field
      of haptics and tactile interaction.
