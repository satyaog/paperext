    "description": "This research paper proposes a novel technique called Multi-label Iterated Learning (MILe) to address the challenge of label ambiguity in image classification tasks. The paper explains how the MILe technique utilizes iterated learning to improve the representation of multi-labels from single-label supervision. It demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach on datasets such as ImageNet and WebVision, tackling issues of label noise and distribution shifts.",
