    "description": "The paper introduces the Error Passing Network (EPN), a novel graph-based method that utilizes relationships between samples to improve predictions made by any machine learning model. The aim is to optimize the prediction of VO 2 peak in childhood acute leukemia survivors using this method in conjunction with baseline models. The study demonstrates significant improvement in prediction accuracy, emphasizing the potential of personalized and efficient monitoring in healthcare using the proposed model.",
