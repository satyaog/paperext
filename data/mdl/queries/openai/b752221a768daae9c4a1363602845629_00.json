    "description": "The paper investigates how different mindfulness meditation styles, such as focused attention meditation (FAM) and open monitoring meditation (OMM), affect MEG microstate dynamics and complexity. The study uses a source-level approach to analyze microstates and brain criticality during these meditation practices, exploring the dynamic transitions and complexity of brain activity in experienced Theravada Buddhist monks.",

      "value": "empirical",
      "justification": "The paper presents experimental data and analysis from MEG recordings taken from Buddhist monks practicing different meditation styles, making it an empirical study.",
      "quote": "In this study, we aimed at exploring MEG microstates at source-level during FAM, OMM and in the resting state, as well as the complexity and criticality of dynamic transitions between microstates."
