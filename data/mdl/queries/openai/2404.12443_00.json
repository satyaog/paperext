    "description": "This paper performs the first multi-scale and multi-phase characterization of black-hole-driven outflows in the z ∼ 6.6 quasar J0923+0402 to study the impact on the cold gas reservoir. Using the SimBAL spectral synthesis, it finds a powerful ionized outflow on sub-kiloparsec scales and traces cold gas morphology and kinematics with ALMA observations, detecting a [CII] halo. The research constrains the outflow energetics in both ionized and atomic gas phases at such an early epoch, showing evidence for efficient feedback mechanisms in shaping galaxy properties.",
