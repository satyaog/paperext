    "description": "The paper addresses the challenge of developing reinforcement learning (RL) agents that are robust to variations in safety-critical environments. It introduces the concept of a multi-set robustness problem, aiming to learn a policy that is robust to multiple uncertainty sets. The proposed approach combines elements of system identification and robust RL, referred to as System Identification and Risk-Sensitive Adaptation (SIRSA). The paper compares this method with existing techniques, showing its effectiveness in improving worst-case performance across diverse control tasks.",
