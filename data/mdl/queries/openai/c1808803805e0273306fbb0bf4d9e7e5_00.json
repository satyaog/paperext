    "description": "This paper discusses the extension of a previously developed model to derive homotopic areal-level parcellations of the human cerebral cortex using resting-state functional connectivity. These homotopic parcellations maintain homogeneity and correlate with brain lateralization, providing a neurobiologically meaningful subdivision of the cortex.",

      "quote": "Using resting-fMRI and task-fMRI across diverse scanners, acquisition protocols, preprocessing and demographics, we show that the resulting homotopic parcellations are as homogeneous as the Schaefer parcellations, while being more homogeneous than five publicly available parcellations."
