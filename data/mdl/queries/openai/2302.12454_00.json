    "description": "In this paper, the authors introduce an efficient method named Stochastic Simulated Quantum Annealing (SSQA) to solve large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. The SSQA method is based on stochastic computing and quantum Monte Carlo approaches, which emulate quantum behavior using classical computers. The paper demonstrates the efficacy of SSQA in solving graph isomorphism problems with up to 2500 spins, showing significant improvements in convergence speed compared to traditional methods.",
