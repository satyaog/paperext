    "description": "The paper investigates the ethnic/racial biases in predictive models built to predict behavioral phenotypes from brain functional MRI data. It uses two large U.S. datasets to assess if prediction models trained predominantly on data from white Americans generalize to other ethnic groups, specifically African Americans. The paper highlights that prediction accuracy is generally lower for African Americans, underscoring a need for more representation in training datasets to improve model fairness.",
