    "description": "The paper reevaluates the conventional training protocols used for multi-agent communication, specifically focusing on the limitations of current population-level communication strategies in sender-receiver Lewis games. The authors propose an alternative training protocol called 'partitioning', which aims to limit co-adaptation among agents, thereby improving communicative success and language development within larger populations. Experimental results show that this new approach enhances communication with new agents and promotes the development of more compositional languages.",
    "type": {
      "value": "empirical",
      "justification": "The paper conducts several experimental analyses to test the proposed partitioning protocol and compare it with the standard training protocol. The focus is on empirical results and observations derived from these experiments.",
      "quote": "In experiments, we find that agents trained in partitioned populations are able to communicate successfully with new communication partners with which they have never interacted during training, and that languages spoken by various agents tend to be similar to one another."
