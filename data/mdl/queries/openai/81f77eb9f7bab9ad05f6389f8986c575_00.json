    "description": "This paper discusses the implications of conscious AI in primary healthcare, exploring both theoretical and practical aspects. It delves into the concept of AI consciousness and its potential effects on medical practices such as diagnosis, shared decision-making, and resource management. The commentary highlights the ethical considerations and uncertainties surrounding conscious AI and suggests areas for future research, including stakeholder attitudes and ethical guidelines.",

      "value": "theoretical",
      "justification": "The paper explores theoretical aspects of AI consciousness, using philosophical theories and ethical considerations to discuss its potential implications in healthcare.",
      "quote": "Given this uncertainty and the high stakes associated with the use of AI in primary healthcare, it is imperative to be prepared for all scenarios including conscious AI systems being used for medical diagnosis, shared decision-making and resource management in the future."
