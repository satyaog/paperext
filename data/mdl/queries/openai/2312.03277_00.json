    "description": "The paper proposes a scalable framework for optimizing cellular radio access networks (RAN) using reinforcement learning (RL). The central innovation is applying anomaly detection techniques to assess the compatibility between sites (tasks) and the RL policy bank. This approach enables efficient reuse of RL policies, leading to significant computational savings and making the method applicable under real-world constraints.",
