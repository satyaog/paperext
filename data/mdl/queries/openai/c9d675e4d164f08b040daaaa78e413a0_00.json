    "description": "This paper surveys optimization problems that involve the cardinality of variable vectors in constraints or the objective function. It provides a unified viewpoint on problem classes and models, discussing techniques across different fields such as signal processing, portfolio optimization, and machine learning. The paper emphasizes the applicability of mixed-integer programming for solving these problems.",
