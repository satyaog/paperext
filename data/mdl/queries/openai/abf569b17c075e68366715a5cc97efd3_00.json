    "description": "This paper addresses the challenges of modeling stochastic and irregularly sampled time series, particularly in medicine. It introduces a method called Trajectory Flow Matching (TFM) which trains Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (Neural SDEs) in a simulation-free manner to improve scalability and stability. The paper establishes necessary conditions for TFM to learn time series data, presents a stabilization trick, and adapts TFM to clinical time series, showing improved performance on multiple datasets.",
