    "description": "This paper introduces a model-free approach to tackle choice-based competitive facility location problems by leveraging simulation and submodularity. It reformulates the problem into a maximum covering location problem, estimates preference profiles through simulation, and proposes a partial Benders decomposition for efficient solving. The solutions are compared to existing benchmark methods, showing improved performance under certain conditions.",

      "quote": "We develop a theoretical analysis of our approach and show that the solution quality it provides for the original stochastic problem, its computational performance, and the automatic profile-retention strategy it exploits are directly connected to the entropy of the preference profiles in the population."
