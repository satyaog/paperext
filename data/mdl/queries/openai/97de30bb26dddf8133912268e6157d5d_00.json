    "description": "This study provides empirical evidence that sleep spindles reflect learning-related cortical networks and facilitate memory consolidation. Using various methods, the research demonstrates a link between the topographies of post-learning sleep spindles and prior learning patterns, highlighting the role of spindle amplitude in predicting memory retention.",
