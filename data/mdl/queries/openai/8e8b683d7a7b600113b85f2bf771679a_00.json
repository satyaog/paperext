    "description": "The paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) are aware of the extent of their own knowledge. By developing a benchmark that challenges the models to enumerate information they possess on specific topics, it examines if LLMs can recall the precise amount of required information. The study benchmarks various LLM models such as OPT, Pythia, and Flan-T5 and finds that with sufficient scaling, all tested models can demonstrate this capability.",
