    "description": "This paper addresses the performance deterioration of Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) models when tested on out-of-domain datasets, specifically in whole slide images (WSIs) for medical diagnosis. The authors propose the Retrieval-AugMented MIL (RAM-MIL) framework, which integrates Optimal Transport (OT) for nearest neighbor retrieval. This method improves both in-domain and out-of-domain performance by reducing the intrinsic dimension of input features and enhancing model generalization.",
