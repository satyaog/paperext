    "description": "The paper investigates the use of eigenspectrum decay in neural networks to assess the quality of representations learned through self-supervised learning (SSL). The eigenspectrum decay coefficient is proposed as a measure of representation quality, potentially allowing for task-agnostic evaluation of models without downstream task labels. The authors demonstrate that the decay coefficient is related to generalization performance across various network architectures and datasets.",
