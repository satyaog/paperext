    "description": "This paper explores the genetic differences among autistic individuals, investigating the contributions of common and de novo genetic variants to core and associated autism features, developmental disabilities, and sex differences. Using data from large autism cohorts, the study identifies genetic associations with phenotypic heterogeneity in autism and emphasizes the need for deeper phenotypic characterization.",
