    "description": "The paper investigates the effectiveness of a structured debriefing protocol designed to enhance non-technical skills (NTS) such as situational awareness, communication, and leadership among medical students during pediatric trauma simulations. The study involves a randomized controlled trial with medical students from Brazil and Canada, improving skills evaluated through self-assessment surveys and NOTSS scoring.",
