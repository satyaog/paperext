    "description": "The paper proposes Feature Conformal Prediction (Feature CP), which extends conformal prediction techniques to semantic feature spaces using deep representation learning. This method aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of predictive inference by leveraging the inductive biases of deep learning features. Theoretical and empirical validations are provided, demonstrating superior performance on tasks like ImageNet classification and Cityscapes segmentation.",
