    "description": "The paper investigates the potential for Q-learning agents to learn collusive strategies in the iterated prisoner's dilemma. The authors characterize the conditions under which Q-learners can learn to cooperate using optimistic Q-values, demonstrating theoretical convergence towards the cooperative Pavlov strategy.",
