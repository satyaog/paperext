    "description": "This paper introduces a method to automate the design of solid-state materials, particularly 3D crystal structures, using behavioral cloning. The research proposes a policy network that incorporates Euclidean equivariance, framing the problem as a sequential prediction task. The study investigates the effectiveness of training a behavioral cloning agent on trajectories generated from known crystals.",
