    "description": "This paper examines the effectiveness of various pre-processing techniques on the performance, specifically focusing on fairness and accuracy, of data-driven models used for predicting building operations such as lighting status. It introduces a new sequentially balanced sampling method and compares it with existing techniques like random sampling and sequential sampling.",
    "type": {
      "value": "empirical",
      "justification": "The study involves empirical experiments and case studies applying pre-processing techniques to evaluate their effect on data-driven building models.",
      "quote": "In this study, a sequentially balanced sampling (SBS) technique is proposed. Its generalizability to improve fairness and preserve accuracy of DDBMs is compared with four existing pre-processing techniques—random sampling (RS), sequential sampling (SS), reversed preferential sampling (RPS), and sequential preferential sampling (SPS). Totally, 4960 cases are carried out to apply these pre-processing techniques."
