    "description": "The paper evaluates a deep learning-based approach to predict peptide length from mass spectra, aiming to enhance peptide identification rates in mass spectrometry. It integrates the predictions into a peptide search engine, Pepid, and demonstrates improvements in identification accuracy through empirical evaluation on several datasets.",

      "value": "empirical",
      "justification": "The paper involves the empirical evaluation of a proposed deep learning model, testing it on multiple datasets and comparing its performance against benchmarks.",
      "quote": "We show that solving one subproblem from this example decomposition (namely, peptide length prediction) is both reliably achievable using deep learning, as well as proving a valuable asset as part of a state-of-the-art database-driven peptide identification pipeline.\nIn this paper, we demonstrate that a deep learning-based method can accurately predict peptide length from the spectrum, and that the predictions from such a method can further\nbe used to achieve higher peptide identifications rates at a fixed false discovery rate (FDR) as well as at fixed false discovery proportions (FDP) using the SPOT\nProteomeTools\npeptide dataset"

Previously, software like MaxQuant\nhave modeled the relation between pep-\ntide length and scores generated by methods such as Mascot , and to derive more confident\nidentifications using that model. This is different from our methodology, where we propose\nto model the length of the peptide based on the spectrum only, and combine that with an\nexternal scoring method."
