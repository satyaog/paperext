    "description": "This research paper addresses the intersection of fairness and privacy in item rankings. In particular, it explores methods to achieve item fairness while preserving user privacy using differential privacy and secure multi-party computation. The paper evaluates the approach's impact on privacy, fairness, and ranking quality using real-world datasets.",
