    "description": "This paper investigates whether recent pretrained models for Visual Question Answering (VQA) can generalize to answer open-ended questions about images outside their training datasets, specifically focusing on their out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization capabilities. Through extensive experiments, the authors evaluate pretrained models on multiple VQA datasets, examining their performance and adaptability. They explore the impact of multimodal pretraining, generative vs. discriminative modeling, and the robustness of automatic evaluation metrics, among other factors.",
