    "description": "The paper ideates a future design workflow involving AI technology, exploring the unique affordances of large AI models, particularly language models, in design processes. It envisions a future where AI contributes significantly through dynamic grounding, constructive negotiation, and sustainable motivation, using the design fiction of 'Squirrel Game' as a prototype to illustrate these concepts.",

      "value": "theoretical",
      "justification": "The paper is primarily focused on conceptualizing future design workflows with AI, theoretical affordances, and speculative design fiction rather than empirical experiments or data.",
      "quote": "Our goal was to refrain from our tendency as HCI systems researchers to jump into implementation... Thus, our contribution is chiefly conceptual."

All three relate to the fact that foundation models (a) embed a wide degree of cultural and social context outside of a specific domain, (b) can apply this understanding to augment outputs within a context."
