    "description": "The study investigates the relationship between arterial stiffness index (ASI), pulse pressure (PP), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers for white matter integrity, utilizing data from the UK Biobank. The primary finding indicates that PP is a better predictor of white matter integrity compared to ASI for individuals aged 45-75 years. However, no significant relationship was found beyond age 75.",
