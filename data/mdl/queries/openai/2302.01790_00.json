    "description": "This paper provides insights into the pitfalls related to validation metrics in image analysis, particularly focusing on image-level classification, semantic and instance segmentation, and object detection tasks. The main contribution is a comprehensive collection, visualization, and discussion of these metric-related pitfalls, categorized by a newly created, domain-agnostic taxonomy.",
