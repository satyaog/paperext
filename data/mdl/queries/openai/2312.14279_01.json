    "description": "The paper focuses on the characterization and classification of developer forum posts based on their intentions. The authors propose a refined taxonomy for the intentions of technical forum posts and design a pre-trained transformer-based model to predict these intentions automatically. Their best model variant achieves competitive performance.",

      "quote": "In this paper, we refer to these reasons as intentions. To exemplify the distinctions between technique-oriented tag taxonomies and an intention-based taxonomy for technical posts, we present a concrete example."
