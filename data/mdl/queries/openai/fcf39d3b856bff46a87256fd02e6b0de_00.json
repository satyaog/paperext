    "description": "The paper explores the intra-host evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in an immunosuppressed patient, providing evidence for the viral reservoir hypothesis. It analyzes the genetic events and mutations that occurred. This study highlights the presence of distinct viral populations in the patient, suggesting the emergence of immune escape variants and a potential ability of the virus to reinfect anatomical locations, not originally sampled, contributing to prolonged infection cases.",
