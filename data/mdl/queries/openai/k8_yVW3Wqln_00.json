    "description": "This paper introduces a method called rectification to reduce the generation of toxic discourses by large language models (LLMs). The proposed method is based on dead-end theory from reinforcement learning and is designed to mitigate toxicity without requiring extensive re-training or internal access to the LLMs. The method uses a smaller separate model to influence token selection such that the probability of generating a toxic discourse is minimized.",
