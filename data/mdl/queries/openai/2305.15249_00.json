    "description": "This paper presents a framework for actor-critic methods in reinforcement learning that co-trains the actor and critic using a joint decision-aware objective. The framework supports any policy and value function parametrization, and guarantees monotonic policy improvement under specific conditions. The framework is validated theoretically and empirically in simple RL environments.",

This property coupled with the use of a critic makes the resulting algorithm sample-efficient in practice. In contrast with TRPO/PPO, both the off-policy actor updates and critic updates in Algorithm 1 are designed to maximize the same lower bound on the policy return."
