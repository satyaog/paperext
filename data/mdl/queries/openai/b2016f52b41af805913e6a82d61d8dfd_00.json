    "description": "This paper discusses the state of shared decision-making (SDM) in Iran, highlighting recent advancements in patient rights and informed consent legislation. Despite these advancements, there is a lack of policies specifically regarding SDM, as well as scarce SDM training and clinical implementation within the country. The paper proposes an adapted SDM model for the Iranian context, developed through a consensus-building process among Iranian clinicians and SDM experts.",
