    "description": "This paper introduces the PASQL (periodic agent-state based Q-learning) algorithm, which is a variant of Q-learning tailored for Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). It aims to leverage non-stationary policies to outperform traditional stationary policies by using periodicity in agent states. The paper includes theoretical analysis proving the convergence of PASQL and numerical experiments demonstrating its advantages over stationary policy algorithms like ASQL.",
