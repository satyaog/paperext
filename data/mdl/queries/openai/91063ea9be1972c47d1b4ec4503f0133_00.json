    "description": "This paper re-evaluates various authorship obfuscation techniques, focusing on detection evasion and content preservation. It introduces a new information-theoretic measure to assess misattribution harm caused by detection evasion. The work identifies several weaknesses in current techniques and offers a competitive baseline using back translation. Experimentation is carried out utilizing state-of-the-art authorship identification and content preservation evaluation methods.",
