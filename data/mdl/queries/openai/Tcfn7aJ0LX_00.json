    "description": "This paper explores the effectiveness of auxiliary tasks in improving the representations learned by deep reinforcement learning agents. The authors introduce a new family of auxiliary tasks based on the successor measure and develop a representation learning algorithm called Proto-Value Networks (PVNs). Through experiments on the Arcade Learning Environment, they demonstrate that PVNs facilitate linear value approximations comparable to established algorithms with fewer interactions with the environment's reward function.",
