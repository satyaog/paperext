    "description": "The paper explores the application of interpretable machine learning models to predict globular clusters (GCs) that may host intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). It addresses the limitations of traditional machine learning models by employing methods for explainability and interpretability, such as the anchors method for XGBoost and natively interpretable models using Certifiably Optimal RulE ListS (CORELS). The study uses data from simulations and evaluates real data for potential IMBH host candidates, providing a measure of prediction confidence and out-of-distribution flags.",
