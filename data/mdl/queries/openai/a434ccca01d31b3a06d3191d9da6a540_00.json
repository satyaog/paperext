    "description": "This paper introduces Temporal Graph Benchmark 2.0 (TGB 2.0), which is a novel benchmarking framework designed to evaluate methods for predicting future links on Temporal Knowledge Graphs and Temporal Heterogeneous Graphs. It emphasizes large-scale datasets and provides eight new datasets for comprehensive evaluations. The paper addresses challenges related to evaluation inconsistencies and limited dataset sizes in previous benchmarks.",
