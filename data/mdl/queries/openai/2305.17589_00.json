    "description": "The paper introduces GRIT, a Graph Transformer incorporating graph inductive biases without using message passing. The model utilizes learned relative positional encodings based on random walk probabilities, a flexible attention mechanism that updates node and node-pair representations, and degree information injection in each layer.",
