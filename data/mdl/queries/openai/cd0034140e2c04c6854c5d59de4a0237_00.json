    "description": "This paper explores poststroke cognitive deficits and their neuroanatomical correlates through a combined multivariable and multioutcome lesion-symptom mapping approach, implemented with canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and support vector regression (SVR). It evaluates how CCA can complement traditional LSM techniques to better relate brain infarcts to cognitive impairments, specifically in verbal memory functions.",
