    "description": "This paper introduces a data-driven model to increase the reliability of the multiple depot vehicle scheduling problem with stochastic travel time (R-MDVSP-STT). It proposes a heuristic branch-and-price algorithm and a labeling algorithm with a stochastic dominance criterion. The paper demonstrates, through computational tests on real-world instances from Montréal, that the proposed method efficiently balances operational costs and schedule reliability.",
