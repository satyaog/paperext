    "description": "The paper discusses the challenges faced by users of Issue Tracking Systems (ITS) in open source software development, specifically when dealing with lengthy and entangled discussions. It introduces SUMMIT, a tool designed to help users collaboratively create and use summaries to make sense of these discussions. The paper includes empirical investigations, design guidelines, and user studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of SUMMIT.",
