    "description": "The paper explores the application of pluralistic frameworks in psychiatry and the enactive approach as a response to the integrative needs of the field. It examines how these concepts can aid in understanding mental disorders by incorporating diverse perspectives (cognitive, biological, phenomenological, etc.) and advocates for an integrative, synthetic-organizational approach to psychiatric practice.",
