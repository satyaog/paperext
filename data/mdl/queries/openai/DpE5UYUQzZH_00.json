    "description": "This paper introduces Magnetic Mirror Descent (MMD), an algorithm designed to unify approaches for solving reinforcement learning problems, quantal response equilibria (QRE), and two-player zero-sum games. The authors demonstrate that MMD achieves linear convergence for QRE in extensive-form games and competitive results in tabular benchmarks compared to algorithms like CFR in self-play settings.",
