    "description": "The paper addresses the challenges in finetuning language models (LMs) based on pairwise preferences, particularly focusing on the underspecified nature of natural language. It proposes a two-step preference modeling procedure to resolve under-specification by selecting a context and then evaluating preference within that context. The authors contribute context-conditioned preference datasets and perform experiments to demonstrate the benefits of context-aware preference modeling, showing improvements in context-specific performance over models like GPT-4 and Llama 3 70B.",
