    "description": "This paper introduces Reaction-GFlowNet (RGFN), an extension of the Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) framework, designed to generate synthesizable molecules through a series of chemical reactions. The proposed method focuses on improving the synthesizability of the generated compounds, thereby enhancing the feasibility of experimental validation. The paper details the methodology, experimental evaluations, and comparisons with state-of-the-art molecular generative models, showcasing the efficacy of RGFN in producing diverse and high-quality molecular candidates that are both synthesizable and cost-effective.",
