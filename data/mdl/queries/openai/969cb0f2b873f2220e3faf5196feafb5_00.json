    "description": "The paper introduces MixEHR-Guided (MixEHR-G), a guided multi-modal topic modeling approach for automatic phenotyping using large-scale electronic health records (EHRs). It addresses the challenge of lacking reliable disease labels by presenting a hierarchical Bayesian topic model that uses surrogate features to align topics with known phenotypes. The approach is applied to EHR datasets like MIMIC-III and PopHR, demonstrating improved interpretability and accuracy of phenotyping compared to unsupervised methods.",
