It proposes a method of evaluating AI systems for consciousness based on \"indicator properties\" derived from these theories.",

      "value": "theoretical",
      "justification": "The paper focuses on theoretical approaches to assessing consciousness in AI systems using neuroscientific theories.",
      "quote": "This report argues for, and exemplifies, a rigorous and empirically grounded approach to AI consciousness: assessing existing AI systems in detail, in light of our best-supported neuroscientific theories of consciousness."

        "quote": "Our analysis suggests that no current AI systems are conscious, but also suggests that there are no obvious technical barriers to building AI systems which satisfy these indicators."
