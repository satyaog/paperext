    "description": "This paper studies the impact of data curation on the iterative retraining of generative models, showing that this process can be regarded as an implicit preference optimization mechanism. It provides theoretical results demonstrating how curated data maximizes the expected reward in such models. Through experiments conducted on synthetic datasets and CIFAR10, the paper illustrates how biases of the reward model are amplified.",
