    "description": "This paper proposes a gradient masked averaging approach to improve generalization in federated learning by focusing on learning invariant mechanisms across clients. The approach aims to address the information loss and poor generalization caused by standard averaging methods in heterogeneous data settings. The proposed method can be integrated into existing federated learning algorithms as a drop-in replacement. The empirical results show consistent performance improvements across various datasets and federated learning algorithms.",
