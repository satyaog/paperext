    "description": "This research paper investigates the mechanism by which statins influence acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell viability, particularly focusing on the role of vesicular trafficking as a key determinant in the statin response. It identifies the role of protein geranylgeranylation and RAB proteins in mediating these effects and explores statins' potential as therapeutic agents for AML.",
