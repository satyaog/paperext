    "description": "This paper is a systematic review assessing Patient-Reported Experience Measures (PREMs) in pediatric surgery. It focuses on identifying the instruments used, their characteristics, and areas for improvement in comparing them to satisfaction surveys. The findings highlight the limited usage of PREMs and the need for their development and implementation in pediatric surgical care.",
