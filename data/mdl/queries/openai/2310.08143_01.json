    "description": "This paper proposes a deep learning approach to enhance the resolution of ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) for visualizing microvascular networks. A realistic mouse brain microvascular network was used to train a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN) based on a V-net architecture. The method was validated both in silico and in vivo, demonstrating improved precision and resolution over conventional ULM.",
