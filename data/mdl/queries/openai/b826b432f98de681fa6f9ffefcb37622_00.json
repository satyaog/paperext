    "description": "The paper introduces a new learned inverse kinematics (IK) model called SMPL-IK, which integrates the SMPL model to offer more flexible and morphology-aware pose editing capabilities. The proposed system allows for AI-driven artistic workflows by enabling pose flexibility with regard to gender and body shape and by supporting custom character integration through a Shape Inversion (SMPL-SI) mechanism.",
