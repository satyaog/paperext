    "description": "This paper presents an analysis of learning methods to distinguish between arguments and modifiers in language. Two models, the argument-only model and the argument-modifier model, are explored to identify how learners can distinguish these constituents using distributional differences within English. The study utilizes computational modeling to evaluate the effectiveness of these models and demonstrates the importance of simplicity biases in learning processes.",
