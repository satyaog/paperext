    "description": "This paper proposes differentially-private algorithms based on stochastic mirror descent for solving convex-concave saddle-point problems with nearly dimension-independent convergence rates. These algorithms improve rates for specific problem settings and utilize various extensions of classical lemmas, providing new insights into differential privacy in machine learning.",
