    "description": "The study investigates the association of functional connectivity subtypes with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. The paper examines the robustness and generalizability of these connectivity subtypes in relation to clinical diagnosis of ASD, leveraging data-driven clustering methods for analysis.",
