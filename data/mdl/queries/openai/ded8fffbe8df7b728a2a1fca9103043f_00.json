    "description": "This paper addresses the challenge of extracting person names from online escort advertisement websites, which are used for advertising victims of human trafficking. It presents NEAT (Name Extraction Against Trafficking), a system that combines rule-based and dictionary extractors with a contextualized language model, significantly improving the accuracy of name extraction in this challenging domain compared to state-of-the-art NER models.",
