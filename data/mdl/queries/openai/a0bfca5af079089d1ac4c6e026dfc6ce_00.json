    "description": "This paper examines the relationship between non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and the growth of SARS-CoV-2 cases in Canada before the country significantly increased vaccine distribution. It assesses whether increased stringency of these interventions directly correlates with reduced case growth across different provinces during two epidemic waves.",
    "type": {
      "value": "empirical",
      "justification": "The study uses empirical data from Canadian provinces to analyze the relationship between NPIs and virus case growth.",
      "quote": "We conducted an ecological time-series study of daily SARS-CoV-2 case growth in Canada from February 2020 to February 2021."

        "quote": "Throughout 2020, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were the primary tools employed by governments and public health agencies to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2."
