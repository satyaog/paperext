    "description": "This paper presents the Diffusion Ensembles for Capturing Uncertainty (DECU) framework for estimating epistemic uncertainty in diffusion models. Using pre-trained networks and a static set of parameters, the framework creates efficient ensembles of diffusion models, introducing innovations such as Pairwise-Distance Estimators (PaiDEs) to measure uncertainty. The paper evaluates the framework on the ImageNet dataset to demonstrate effectiveness in capturing epistemic uncertainty, especially in under-sampled image classes.",
