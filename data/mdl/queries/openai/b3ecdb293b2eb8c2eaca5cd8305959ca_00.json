    "description": "The paper introduces TACT i S, a transformer-based model designed specifically for handling multivariate probabilistic time series prediction. It integrates transformer architecture with attentional copulas to accurately model joint distributions, including complex dependencies and correlations in time series data. The model addresses challenges like irregular sampling, missing data, and scaling to numerous time series, proving to be effective across various real-world datasets.",
