    "description": "The paper discusses the importance of herbarium collections compared to community science platforms like iNaturalist in capturing biodiversity data. It assesses how herbarium specimens and community science observations represent the diversity, distributions, and modeling needs of vascular plants in Canada. The results suggest that herbarium specimens, despite being fewer in number, capture more diversity and environmental niches than iNaturalist observations, emphasizing the need for digitizing existing herbarium collections to enhance biodiversity modeling.",
