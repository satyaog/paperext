    "description": "This paper extends the SynthMorph method by developing a cascaded pipeline of two models for medical image registration, particularly focusing on MRI data of the spinal cord. It aims to provide an accurate and fast solution for multimodal 3D registration using unsupervised deep-learning methods, and it evaluates registration in challenging scenarios with both intra- and inter-subject data.",
