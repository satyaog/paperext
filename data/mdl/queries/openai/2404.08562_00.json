    "description": "The paper presents a novel neural model named DeepEXE designed to enhance binary code vulnerability detection through a state-guided execution process. By using an agent-based implicit neural network and reinforcement learning, the model improves the ability to handle complex binary programs beyond traditional static methods. DeepEXE aims to overcome constraints of current models by leveraging dynamic execution paths and achieving higher accuracy compared to other methods.",
