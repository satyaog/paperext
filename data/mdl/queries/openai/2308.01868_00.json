    "description": "This paper investigates the limitations of independent downscaling of climate variables using deep learning methods, which often violate physical properties between related variables. The authors introduce a framework that incorporates multi-variable hard constraints, ensuring physically-consistent downscaling of climate models.",

      "value": "empirical",
      "justification": "The paper involves experimentation with deep learning models and evaluates their performance in downscaling climate models while ensuring physical consistency.",
      "quote": "To address this, we have proposed a shared model for the desired variables as a partial solution. However, to ensure multi-variable physical constraints, we have introduced a simple and flexible framework that satisfies hard constraints and achieves the same performance or better than standard approaches."
