    "description": "This paper tackles the problem of learning on large text-attributed graphs, where each node is associated with a text description. The authors propose an efficient and effective approach called GLEM, which fuses graph structure and language learning using a variational Expectation-Maximization framework. This method alternates between updating language models and graph neural networks to achieve improved scalability and effectiveness.",
