    "description": "The paper introduces a theoretical framework for using approximate information states in reinforcement learning and planning for partially observed systems. The framework aims to facilitate approximate planning with bounded performance loss, and includes methods that can be learned from data. It focuses on policy gradient algorithms and presents extensive numerical experiments to validate the proposed methods.",
