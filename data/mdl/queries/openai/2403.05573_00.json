    "description": "This paper examines the limitations of predictive decision-making algorithms in the child welfare sector. By analyzing data from risk assessments and case narratives, the authors investigate the potential benefits of incorporating contextual information from casenotes into decision-making processes. They highlight the shortcomings of current risk assessment scores in predicting discharge outcomes and advocate for the use of narrative data to study and inform child welfare systems.",
