    "description": "This research introduces a novel approach to address imbalanced toxic datasets by leveraging reinforcement learning to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) for data augmentation. The method involves using instruction fine-tuning and the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to optimize LLMs, aiming to generate balanced datasets and improve toxicity detection models. The Google Perspective API is utilized as a toxicity evaluator to guide the model. The study demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms existing techniques in generating toxic samples and enhances classifier performance.",
