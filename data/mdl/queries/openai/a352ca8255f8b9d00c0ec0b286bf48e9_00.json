    "description": "The paper proposes an automated system for image segmentation in medical imaging using a foundation model called MedSAM. The system replaces manual prompt conditioning with a module that learns prompt embeddings directly from image embeddings. This method leverages weak supervision and few-shot learning for segmentation tasks, reducing user interaction and adapting better to specific tasks in the medical domain.",
