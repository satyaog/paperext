    "description": "This paper introduces PySCFIPU, a hardware-accelerated data generator using Intelligence Processing Units (IPUs) for creating large quantum chemistry datasets. The researchers used PySCFIPU to generate QM1B, a dataset with one billion training examples containing 9-11 heavy atoms. They demonstrate that a simple neural network, SchNet 9M, improves performance as the volume of training data increases.",
