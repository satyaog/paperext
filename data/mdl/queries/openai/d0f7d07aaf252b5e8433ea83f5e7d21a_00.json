    "description": "This paper introduces Kubric, a scalable, open-source Python framework designed to generate synthetic datasets for computer vision tasks. It allows the creation of photo-realistic scenes with rich annotations by interfacing with PyBullet and Blender. The framework addresses challenges associated with real data collection by enabling synthetic data generation at scale, thus mitigating issues related to privacy, fairness, and legal concerns. Kubric is demonstrated through the creation of 13 datasets for various vision challenges.",
