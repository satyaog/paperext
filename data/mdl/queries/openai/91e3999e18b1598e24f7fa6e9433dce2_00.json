    "description": "The paper proposes a non-intrusive and training-free method to detect behind-the-meter electric vehicle charging events using data from smart meters. The approach does not rely on supervised or unsupervised learning and avoids the need for labeled training data, making it valuable for utility companies in understanding and predicting EV charging patterns. The method is compared with other learning-based approaches for accuracy in a case study using real smart meter data.",
