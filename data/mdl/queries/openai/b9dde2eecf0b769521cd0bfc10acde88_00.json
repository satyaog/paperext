    "description": "This paper focuses on the characterization of voxel-based dosimetry approaches in radioembolization by using a Geant4-based Monte Carlo software called reDoseMC. The study investigates the effect of voxel sizes, image resolutions, target volumes, and tissue materials on the accuracy of dosimetry techniques for radioisotopes Yttrium-90 and Holmium-166. It also emphasizes the importance of standardizing dosimetry protocols for better comparability.",
