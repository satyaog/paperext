      "value": "empirical",
      "justification": "The paper conducts experiments on individuals by analyzing EEG data to study the aperiodic component's response to anesthesia, indicating empirical research.",
      "quote": "Our results demonstrate that the EEG aperiodic com- ponent is more informative about the participantsâ€™ level of consciousness than the oscillatory component."
