    "description": "The paper proposes a novel cell ontology-guided transcriptome foundation model, scCello, which leverages cell ontology information to improve the pre-training of transcriptome foundation models on single-cell RNA sequencing data. By incorporating cell-type coherence loss and ontology alignment loss with masked gene expression prediction, scCello enhances cell representation learning and maintains general-purpose adaptability for various downstream tasks.",
