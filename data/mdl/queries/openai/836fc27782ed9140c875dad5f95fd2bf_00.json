    "description": "This paper proposes a hierarchical Bayesian framework for brain parcellation that integrates both task-based and resting-state fMRI datasets to create a probabilistic atlas. The proposed approach partitions the problem into a spatial arrangement model and a set of dataset-specific emission models, combining their strengths to generate improved group and individual brain parcellations.",
