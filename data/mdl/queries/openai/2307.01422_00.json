    "description": "This paper explores the intersection between Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods (MCMC), positioning GFlowNets under the same theoretical framework as MCMC methods and highlighting both their similarities and differences. The authors introduce a new perspective for GFlowNets using Markov chains, showing how GFlowNets can be viewed as recurrent Markov chains regardless of the state space, and extend the theoretical underpinning of GFlowNets to general state spaces.",
