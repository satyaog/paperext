    "description": "This paper presents a large-scale empirical study focusing on self-admitted technical debt (SATD) in data-intensive systems. The research analyzes 83 SQL-based and 19 NoSQL-based open-source systems to understand the prevalence, composition, and evolution of SATD, especially in data-access logic, and presents new categories of SATD in this context.",
