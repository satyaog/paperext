    "description": "This paper analyzes TCR sequences from over 1,000 individuals to identify two types of TCR repertoires - neonatal and TDT-dependent. It examines how these repertoires develop, persist, and contribute to immune responses against pathogens and autoantigens, as well as their role in conditions such as graft-versus-host disease.",
