    "description": "The paper presents a novel framework that leverages unsupervised concept discovery to reduce spurious correlations in training of deep learning models. It focuses on object-centric representation learning to infer and manage concepts within datasets, thereby enhancing model robustness without requiring human annotation for subgroup labels. The introduced method, Concept Balancing Technique (CoBalT), is evaluated on benchmark datasets like Waterbirds, CelebA, and ImageNet-9, demonstrating improved handling of subpopulation shifts without labeled data.",
