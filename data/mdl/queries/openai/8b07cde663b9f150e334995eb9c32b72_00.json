    "description": "This paper presents an economic evaluation and modeling study focused on needle and syringe programs (NSP) in terms of their clinical and cost-effectiveness on skin, soft tissue, and vascular infections in people who inject drugs (PWID). Through microsimulation modeling, it compares scenarios with and without NSP to determine impacts on morbidity, mortality, and healthcare utilization.",
