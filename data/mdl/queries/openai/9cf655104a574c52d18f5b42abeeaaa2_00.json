    "description": "This paper explores the use of cognitive models as simulators to train AI systems, particularly in the context of moral decision-making. By using cognitive models instead of human interaction, the authors aim to reduce the cost and time associated with training AI systems. The research leverages reinforcement learning agents interacting with a cognitive model of the Ultimatum Game to study fairness and emotional adaptation.",
