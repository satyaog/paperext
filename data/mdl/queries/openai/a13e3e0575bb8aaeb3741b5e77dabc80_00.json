    "description": "This paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software tutorial writing. Through user studies with experienced technical writers, the paper examines how LLMs can assist in background research, resource creation, and maintaining quality standards in tutorial writing. It identifies challenges associated with LLMs, such as unpredictable output and difficulty in interface usability, and provides recommendations for designing LLM-based tutorial writing tools.",
