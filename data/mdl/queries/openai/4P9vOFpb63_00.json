    "description": "This paper proposes a method called Random Orthogonal Subspace Adaptation (ROSA) to adapt large pre-trained language models to downstream tasks efficiently, addressing memory constraints without adding latency overhead during inference. It compares the method to existing Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods and demonstrates its effectiveness on GPT-2 models for Natural Language Generation tasks.",

Notably, ROSA consistently outperforms LoRA with a significant margin in terms of perplexity. For example, ROSA achieves a +1.4 improvement in perplexity over LoRA for the finetuning of GPT2-S with 11M trainable parameters. Additionally, the training curves depicted in Figure 2a demonstrate that increasing the rank of the trainable matrix benefits ROSA, whereas LoRA does not exhibit the same advantage. This observation aligns with the findings reported by the authors of LoRA (Hu et al., 2021)."
