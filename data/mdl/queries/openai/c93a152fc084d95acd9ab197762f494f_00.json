    "description": "This paper explores the morphological brain differences associated with living alone, using a large sample from the UK Biobank. The study investigates how solitary living affects brain structures, particularly focusing on the default mode network, and assesses sex-specific neural differences. It correlates brain morphology with behavioral traits like loneliness and social support.",
