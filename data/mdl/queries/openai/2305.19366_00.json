    "description": "This paper introduces a new method called JSP-GFN for approximating the joint posterior distribution over the structure and parameters of a Bayesian Network using a single Generative Flow Network. The approach involves a two-phase sampling process: generating the DAG sequentially one edge at a time, followed by sampling the parameters. The method is validated empirically against existing methods using simulated and real datasets, and demonstrates favorable results.",
