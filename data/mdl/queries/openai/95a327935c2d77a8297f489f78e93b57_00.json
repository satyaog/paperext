    "description": "This paper introduces a novel method for injective 3D deformations by leveraging the composition of 2D mesh-based deformations. The method, TutteNet, aims to overcome inaccuracies and inefficiencies in current methods by ensuring injectivity in deformations and integrating into optimization and learning frameworks. TutteNet is shown to outperform other injective methods and maintains the integrity of deformations across different applications like NeRF and SDF deformations.",
