    "description": "This research paper presents the design, testing, and validation of a parallel transmission/receive coil array for MRI of the human neck and cervical/upper thoracic spinal cord at 7 Tesla. The coil array, consisting of eight transmit dipoles and twenty receive loops, aims to improve the quality of MRI scans by enhancing B1 uniformity and signal-to-noise ratio. The study demonstrates the coil's effectiveness compared to existing solutions.",
