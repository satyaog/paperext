    "description": "The paper proposes a new memory-augmented version of the Adam optimizer, called Adam+CM (Adam with Critical Momenta), designed to explore flatter minima in the loss landscape by incorporating a buffer of critical momentum terms during training. This approach aims to improve model performance on various tasks, including image classification and language modeling, by encouraging exploration and avoiding sharp minima. The paper provides both theoretical analysis and empirical results to validate the effectiveness of the proposed optimizer.",
