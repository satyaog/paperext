    "description": "This paper explores how artificial agents can augment human cognitive capacities by mimicking brain processes. It emphasizes the integration of the free energy principle (FEP) with temporo-spatial dynamics (TSD) for adaptive intelligence augmentation. These insights are applied to various applications, such as psychiatric self-regulation and disaster prediction.",

      "value": "theoretical",
      "justification": "The paper develops theoretical models based on principles from neuroscience to propose a new class of artificial agents.",
      "quote": "We propose a novel AI approach. Rather than creating human intelligence, we propose augmenting it. For that purpose, we suggest taking lessons from the brain as a key strategy in attempts to build artificial agents that can support and augment human selves."
