    "description": "This paper presents a framework for analyzing risk and learning rate dynamics in high-dimensional optimization problems, using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with adaptive learning rates. It examines two specific adaptive rates, AdaGrad-Norm and exact line search, focusing on least squares problems, and explores how the learning rates converge and adapt over time according to data covariance.",
