    "description": "The paper presents a machine learning model named EpiTopics aimed at automating the detection and prediction of non-pharmacological interventions (NPI) changes related to COVID-19 from news reports. Using a combination of topic modeling and transfer learning, the model identifies topics from a large set of unlabeled news reports and associates these topics with NPIs to predict changes in their status across 42 countries.",
