    "description": "This study investigates how technologically-assisted communication, as opposed to face-to-face interaction, affects inter-brain synchrony. The research focuses on mother-child interactions using hyperscanning EEG to measure neural synchrony and examines how this synchrony correlates with social behaviors such as shared gaze and empathic engagement.",
