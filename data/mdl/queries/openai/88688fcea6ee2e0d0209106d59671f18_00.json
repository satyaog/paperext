    "description": "This paper investigates the optimal control of network-coupled subsystems through spectral decomposition techniques, enabling scalable control solutions for large-scale systems by leveraging the properties of graph theory. It focuses on decomposing systems based on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of coupling matrices, reducing the complexity of control problems significantly.",
    "type": {
      "value": "theoretical",
      "justification": "The paper presents a theoretical investigation into control systems using spectral decomposition, as indicated by its focus on theoretical aspects such as eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and Riccati equations without empirical experimentation.",
      "quote": "A key feature which distinguishes our approach from these previous work is that our approach is applicable to models where the coupling between agents are not homogeneous and that we establish optimal solutions rather than an approximate solution."
