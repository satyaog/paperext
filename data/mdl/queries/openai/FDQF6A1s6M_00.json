    "description": "This paper introduces LOQA, a decentralized reinforcement learning algorithm aimed at optimizing an agent’s utility and fostering cooperation in partially competitive environments. The algorithm assumes opponents make decisions based on their Q-learning action-value functions. It is shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance in scenarios like the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma and the Coin Game, with reduced computational demands.",
