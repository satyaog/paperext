    "description": "This paper explores the development and proof-of-concept of a hydrated electron dosimeter for use in clinical radiotherapy applications. It investigates how hydrated electrons, which increase the optical absorption of water, can be utilized to create dosimeters that are near-tissue-equivalent. The study measures the optical absorption associated with hydrated electrons produced by clinical linear accelerators and assesses the technique's suitability for radiotherapy applications.",
