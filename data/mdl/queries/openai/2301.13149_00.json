    "description": "The paper investigates cutting planes derived from the Dantzig-Wolfe (DW) decomposition algorithm in mixed-integer programming (MIP). It demonstrates that these cuts can provide the same dual bounds as DW decomposition while incorporating them into the original formulation to potentially improve computational performance. The paper includes discussions on strengthening these cuts and presents computational results on specific problems.",
