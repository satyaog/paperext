    "description": "This paper proposes a method called 'dev2vec' to represent the domain expertise of developers through embedding vectors derived using doc2vec. The embeddings are constructed from multiple sources of developers' contributions on GitHub, such as repository descriptions, issue resolving history, and API calls in commits. The paper demonstrates that these embeddings can improve the classification of developers into job roles compared to state-of-the-art methods.",
