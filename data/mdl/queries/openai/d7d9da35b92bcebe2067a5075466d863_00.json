    "description": "This paper provides a comprehensive review of continual reinforcement learning (RL), including different formulations and approaches, a taxonomy of continual RL methods, evaluation benchmarks, and their connections to neuroscience. It outlines the key challenges and areas for future research in the domain of continual RL.",

      "value": "theoretical",
      "justification": "The paper primarily discusses various theoretical frameworks, taxonomies, and perspectives on continual RL, rather than conducting experiments or empirical analyses of new methods.",
      "quote": "In this article, we aim to provide a literature review of different formulations and approaches to continual reinforcement learning (RL), also known as lifelong or non-stationary RL."
