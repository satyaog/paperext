    "description": "This paper introduces Graph Fourier Maximum Mean Discrepancy (GFMMD), a novel distance measure between distributions and signals on graphs, particularly useful for analyzing high-dimensional data modeled as graphs such as single-cell RNA-sequencing data. The study also discusses an efficient computational method for GFMMD and demonstrates its application in biological data analysis.",
