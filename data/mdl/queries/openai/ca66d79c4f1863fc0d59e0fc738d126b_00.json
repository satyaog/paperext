    "description": "This paper introduces ULTRAQUERY, a foundation model designed for zero-shot logical query reasoning in knowledge graphs (KGs). The paper focuses on complex logical query answering (CLQA) which involves compositional queries with logical operations. ULTRAQUERY aims to provide inductive reasoning capabilities, allowing it to perform well across different KGs without being trained on specific entities or relation vocabularies, emphasizing zero-shot capability. The model leverages pre-trained inductive KG completion operations and fuzzy logic for non-parametric logical operations. The study evaluates ULTRAQUERY on 23 datasets, setting a new state of the art in 15.",
