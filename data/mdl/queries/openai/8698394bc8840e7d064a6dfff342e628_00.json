    "description": "The paper presents a method for 3D detailization that allows users to enhance the geometry of coarse 3D shapes by applying styles from exemplar shapes. This is achieved through a Pyramid GAN structure that enables localized and controllable detailization, producing high-resolution geometric details that maintain structural integrity.",
