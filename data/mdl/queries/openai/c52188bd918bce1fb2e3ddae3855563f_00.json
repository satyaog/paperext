    "description": "The paper introduces a novel connection between online active learning (OAL) and the Partial Monitoring (PM) framework, proposing a new method called NeuralCBP. This approach is designed for cost-sensitive OAL tasks and leverages neural networks to account for predictive uncertainty. The study demonstrates that NeuralCBP competes with and often outperforms existing baselines across binary, multi-class, and cost-sensitive OAL tasks.",
