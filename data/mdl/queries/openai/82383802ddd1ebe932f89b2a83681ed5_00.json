    "description": "This paper investigates compositional generalization within dependency parsing by creating a gold-standard set of dependency parses for the CFQ dataset and evaluating the performance of a state-of-the-art dependency parser on this dataset. The study finds that while the parser's performance degrades with increased compound divergence, the degradation varies across different dataset splits. It identifies specific syntactic structures that particularly challenge the parser's ability to generalize compositionally.",
