    "description": "The paper presents a novel framework called collective Hidden Interaction Tensor Factorization (cHITF) for modeling inter-modal correspondences in multi-modal electronic health records (EHR). It builds on non-negative tensor factorization to improve the discovery of phenotypes without the need for pre-defined inter-modal interactions, which are often unavailable in real-world datasets. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of cHITF using the MIMIC-III and eICU datasets, providing clinically relevant and diverse phenotypes with improved predictive performance.",
