    "description": "The paper explores the limitations of equivariant neural networks in breaking symmetry at the level of individual data samples and introduces the concept of 'relaxed equivariance' as a solution. It also discusses the implementation of this relaxation in equivariant multilayer perceptrons (E-MLPs) and its implications across various application domains such as physics, graph representation learning, combinatorial optimization, and equivariant decoding.",

Define XH = {x ∈ X | Gx ⊇ H} as the invariant subspace of X under H and PXH as the projection matrix onto the subspace XH . Additionally, define [H] to be the conjugacy class of some subgroup H ⊆ G, and X[H] = {x ∈ X | ∃K ∈ [H] s.t.Gx ⊇ K} to be the set of inputs stabilized by a group in [H], e.g. inputs of type [H]. Then, for a weight matrix W ∈ Rm×n, if there exists a K ∈ [H] such that for all left cosets C ∈ G/K₁W ₋ ρ′(g)T Wρ (g) PXK = 0,where g ∈ C is an arbitrary coset representative, then the map ϕ : X[H] → Y, x → Wx satisfies relaxed equivariance."
