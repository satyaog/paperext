    "description": "The paper explores the effect of mixing times on continual reinforcement learning. It introduces scalable Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) characterized by polynomial mixing times. The research demonstrates that these mixing times pose significant challenges for existing reinforcement learning approaches, manifesting as myopic bias and bootstrapping issues. Empirical analysis is conducted using Atari and Mujoco benchmarks to validate the theoretical claims.",
