    "description": "The paper explores the use of binary activated neural networks to achieve interpretability and explainability in regression tasks using tabular data. It introduces and analyzes a greedy algorithm, the Binary Greedy Network (BGN), designed to construct these networks one neuron at a time, optimizing their architecture for task-specific requirements. The study further proposes an efficient computation method for SHAP values to assess individual contributions of network elements, including features, neurons, and connections, enhancing the interpretability of binary activated networks.",
