    "description": "The paper presents a reduction methodology from reinforcement learning (RL) to no-regret online learning using the saddle-point formulation of RL. This approach decomposes the RL problem into two parts: regret minimization and function approximation. By applying this reduction, new RL algorithms can be systematically designed. The paper also proposes an RL algorithm based on mirror descent via a generative-model oracle, providing provable performance guarantees.",
