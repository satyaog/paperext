    "description": "The paper presents a novel approach to goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) using denoising diffusion models. The proposed method, named Merlin, learns a goal-conditioned policy to reverse away from potential goal states, avoiding the need to learn a separate value function. The approach is validated on various offline goal-reaching tasks, demonstrating significant performance and computational efficiency improvement over state-of-the-art methods.",
