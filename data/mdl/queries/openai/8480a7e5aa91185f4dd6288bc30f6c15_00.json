    "description": "This paper discusses the creation of the LakeTEMP dataset, which includes surface water temperature and ice phenology data for 1.4 million lakes around the world. The dataset provides observational data and interpolated predictions of ice cover for lakes larger than 0.1 km2. The observations were derived from Landsat 8 satellite imagery and underwent validation and quality control procedures.",
