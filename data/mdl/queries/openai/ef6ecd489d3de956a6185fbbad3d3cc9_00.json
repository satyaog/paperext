    "description": "This paper investigates the relationship between brain criticality and consciousness, particularly during anesthetic-induced unresponsiveness. It explores the dynamics of EEG in subjects under various anesthetics and predicts the perturbational complexity index (PCI) using criticality measures. The study provides evidence supporting the hypothesis that critical neuronal dynamics are essential for consciousness.",
