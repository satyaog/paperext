    "description": "This paper bridges two families of probabilistic algorithms: variational inference (VI) for modeling distributions over continuous spaces and generative flow networks (GFlowNets) for distributions over discrete structures. The paper establishes their equivalence under certain conditions, delineates their differences, and experimentally shows the advantage of GFlowNets in capturing multimodal distributions through off-policy training and reduced gradient variance.",
