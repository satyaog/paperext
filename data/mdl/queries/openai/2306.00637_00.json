    "description": "This paper introduces Wurstchen, a novel three-stage architecture for text-to-image synthesis. The architecture aims to achieve state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced computational requirements compared to existing models such as Stable Diffusion 2.1. The key contribution is a latent diffusion technique using a highly compressed semantic image representation. The study shows that Wurstchen performs efficiently in terms of image quality, computational cost, and inference speed.",
