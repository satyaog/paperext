    "description": "This paper presents a novel algorithm for Monte Carlo integration used in physically based rendering. The proposed method improves the stratification of samples and enhances the perceptual quality of rendered images by introducing blue-noise error distribution while retaining the advantages of inverse CDF sampling without its limitations. The research paper elaborates on how the novel sampling method has the potential to improve rendering performance and quality by enabling efficient single-pass resampling.",
