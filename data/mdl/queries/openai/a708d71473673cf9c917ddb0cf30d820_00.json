    "description": "This paper reviews existing literature on plasticity-related mechanisms in neuroscience, discussing how these mechanisms relate to gradient estimationâ€”a concept widely studied in machine learning. The authors argue that the concept of gradients is essential to understanding the processes of learning and adaptation in the brain, suggesting that neuroscientists have implicitly been studying gradient-based changes in their quest to understand plasticity and learning.",
