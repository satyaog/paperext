    "description": "This paper presents R5, a framework designed to enhance systematicity in machine intelligence, enabling small-scale tasks to be extrapolated to larger-scale tasks. R5 employs deep reinforcement learning for reasoning over relational graph data, offering a high recall in rule discovery and outperforming other models in relation prediction tasks.",
