    "description": "The paper explores enhancing the precision of immunotherapy by utilizing TCR/CAR antagonism, which leverages TCR's ability to discern self and non-self antigens, transferring this specificity onto CARs. This approach is tested in various leukemia and melanoma models, demonstrating improved specificity and reduced toxicity.",
