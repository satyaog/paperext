    "description": "The paper introduces Nash Learning from Human Feedback (NLHF), an alternative approach to fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using human preferences. The approach revolves around learning a preference model instead of a reward model and finding the Nash equilibrium of this preference model. The paper also presents new algorithms, particularly Nash-MD, inspired by mirror descent, and conducts empirical experiments on a text summarization task.",
