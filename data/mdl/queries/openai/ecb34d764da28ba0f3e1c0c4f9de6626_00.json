    "description": "The paper introduces the Unsupervised Dependency Graph Network (UDGN), a novel model designed to induce syntactic dependency structures directly from raw text through masked language modeling tasks. The UDGN leverages self-attention mechanisms to achieve strong performance in unsupervised dependency parsing, matching human-annotated dependency types without requiring gold part-of-speech tags or other external information. The model is evaluated across tasks such as masked language modeling and sentence similarity, demonstrating its effectiveness in learning structural dependencies relevant to various NLP tasks.",
