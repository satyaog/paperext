    "description": "This paper introduces NeoRS, a specialized preprocessing pipeline for neonatal resting-state fMRI data. NeoRS is designed to address the unique challenges posed by neonatal brain imaging, including variability in brain size and contrast differences due to myelination that make adult pipelines unsuitable. Developed as an open-source tool, NeoRS integrates popular neuroimaging tools like FSL, AFNI, and SPM. It supports parallel computing via Matlab to expedite processing and includes functionalities for data preprocessing, quality control, and functional connectivity analysis. Evaluated using Baby Connectome Project data, NeoRS facilitates robust and adaptable rsfMRI data analysis for neonates.",
