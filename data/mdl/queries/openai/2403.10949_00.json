    "description": "This paper introduces SelfIE, a framework for enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret their own embeddings in natural language. The framework leverages LLMs' ability to respond to prompts to decode and represent complex concepts within hidden embeddings without additional training. It aims to provide transparency in LLM reasoning, particularly in ethical decision-making and handling of harmful knowledge. SelfIE also supports supervising and controlling the reasoning processes by editing concept representations at specific layers.",
