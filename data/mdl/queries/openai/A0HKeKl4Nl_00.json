    "description": "This paper presents an empirical analysis of how fine-tuning alters pre-trained models in synthetic, controlled tasks. It demonstrates that fine-tuning tends to apply a minimal transformation on top of existing capabilities, creating an illusion of capability change. The study uses specifically designed tasks and datasets like TinyStories to provide insights into capability modification through fine-tuning.",
