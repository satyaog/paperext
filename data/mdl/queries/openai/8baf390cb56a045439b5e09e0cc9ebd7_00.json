    "description": "This paper studies Latent Diffusion Models focusing on their training efficiency and performance using existing and novel conditioning mechanisms. The authors re-implement several models to provide a fair comparison and propose a novel conditioning mechanism. They particularly enhance class-conditional generation on ImageNet-1k and text-to-image generation on CC12M datasets.",
