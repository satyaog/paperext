    "description": "The paper introduces REx (Refine, Explore, Exploit), an algorithm that efficiently performs code refinement using large language models (LLMs) by addressing the explore-exploit tradeoff through Thompson Sampling. REx is applied to tasks such as competition programming, visual reasoning puzzles from the Abstraction and Reasoning corpus (ARC), and software verification problems involving nonlinear loop invariants, showing improved problem-solving with fewer language model calls.",
