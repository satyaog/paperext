    "description": "This paper proposes a new quality scoring tool, METhodological RadiomICs Score (METRICS), designed to improve the research quality of radiomics studies. It describes the method of development using a modified Delphi study with international experts, and details the structure of the tool, including its items and categories. The paper also discusses the implementation of a web application for score calculation and encourages feedback from the research community.",
