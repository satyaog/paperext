    "description": "This study investigates how global signal topography in the human brain changes across different ages, utilizing a large sample of resting-state fMRI data. The findings indicate that global signal regression, commonly used for data denoising, affects functional connectivity differently based on age, which has crucial implications for lifespan network neuroscience.",

In functional neuroimaging generally, and in human connectomics investigations utilizing resting state functional MRI (fMRI) specifically, this challenge has been met with the development of processing pipelines that mitigate artifacts known to obscure the underlying neural signal (2)."
