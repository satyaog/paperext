    "description": "The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of pruning artificial neural networks in accelerating the solution time of mixed-integer programming problems that incorporate ANNs. It emphasizes the advantages of structured pruning over unstructured pruning, particularly for improving the scalability of embedding ANNs into MIPs. The paper includes experimental results using feed-forward neural networks to validate the approach.",
