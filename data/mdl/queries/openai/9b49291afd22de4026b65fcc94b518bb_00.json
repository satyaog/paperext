    "description": "The paper investigates how single-neuron input-output adaptive mechanisms, optimized in an end-to-end fashion in artificial recurrent neural networks, impact network computations and network robustness to noise and changes in input statistics. By introducing Adaptive Recurrent Units (ARUs) that mimic the diversity of neuronal activation functions observed in the brain, the study demonstrates improved network performance and stability.",
