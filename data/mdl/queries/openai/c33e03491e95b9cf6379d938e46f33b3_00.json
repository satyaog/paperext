    "description": "The paper proposes a novel evaluation method for generative models focusing on nominal categorical data. It introduces a synthetic data setting to return where the ground truth is known, emphasizing probabilistic guarantees and sample complexities. The method involves coarsening high-dimensional probability spaces to smaller spaces, allowing for meaningful statistical estimates.",
