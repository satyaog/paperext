    "description": "The paper presents a method called \"SetFeat\" that deviates from the conventional practice of extracting a single feature vector per input image in image classification, proposing instead to extract sets of feature vectors. This approach involves embedding shallow self-attention mechanisms within existing encoder architectures to produce these sets, aiming to achieve a richer and more transferable representation for few-shot classification tasks. The effectiveness of SetFeat is demonstrated through experiments on standard few-shot datasets, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods.",
