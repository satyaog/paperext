    "description": "This paper explores how induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) express a unique set of pluripotency-associated MHC I peptides (paMAPs) that are also found in various human cancers, highlighting their potential role in cancer immunotherapy. The study delves into the immunopeptidomics of iPSCs and identifies 46 paMAPs absent in normal tissues but present in cancer cells, potentially aiding immune evasion.",
