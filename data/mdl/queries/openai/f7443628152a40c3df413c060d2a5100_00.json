    "description": "This paper investigates sensory processing heterogeneity (hypo and hyper sensory processing) in autism spectrum disorders. It explores clinical stratification and investigates genetic pathways associated with these sensory profiles using the dSSP score derived from the Short Sensory Profile (SSP). Data from 1136 participants, including autistic individuals, relatives, and controls, were analyzed, showing significant differences in dSSP scores related to genetic mutations in GABA-ergic pathways. The study provides insights into the biological underpinnings of sensory processing in autism.",
