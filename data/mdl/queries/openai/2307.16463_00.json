    "description": "The paper introduces a novel denoising diffusion probabilistic modeling (DDPM) methodology called Gen-neG that utilizes oracle-assisted guidance. This method incorporates side-information via an oracle, which labels samples as either good or bad, to steer the generative process towards valid sample spaces. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of Gen-neG in scenarios such as collision avoidance in self-driving simulators and safety-guarded human motion generation.",
