    "description": "This paper explores the relationship between prediction accuracy and feature importance reliability in neuroimaging data, both empirically and theoretically. It utilizes various predictive models and the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset to analyze this relationship. The study demonstrates how Haufe-transformed weights can achieve reliable feature importance and discusses the implications of prediction accuracy across phenotypes.",
