    "description": "This paper investigates the challenges of using traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods in high-frequency decision contexts, such as in quantitative finance, robotics, and autonomous driving, where the state of the environment evolves continuously. It explores how distributional RL (DRL) agents are sensitive to decision frequency and introduces concepts such as distributional action gaps and superiority as a probabilistic generalization of the advantage function. The authors propose a superiority-based DRL algorithm to improve performance in high-frequency environments, validated through simulations in an option-trading domain.",
