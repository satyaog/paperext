    "description": "This paper proposes a domain adaptation method that operates without retraining existing pre-trained models. Instead, the method uses a feature selection process to adapt the target domain data to the source model. The proposed solution addresses both weakly-supervised and unsupervised domain adaptation, particularly when dealing with tabular data that have categorical and numerical attributes. It introduces a pseudo-label estimation technique for unlabeled data and aims to provide interpretable target-to-source transformations.",
