    "description": "This paper introduces SAGE, an LLM-based smart home assistant agent that overcomes common limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using a sequential decision-making process with dynamically constructed LLM prompts and a set of specialized tools for flexible user preference management, device interaction, persistent monitoring, and natural device referencing. The paper also presents a benchmark of 50 challenging smart home tasks where SAGE demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing LLM-enabled baselines.",
