    "description": "The paper discusses the history, current status, and future directions of the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a community-driven standard for organizing neuroscience data. It outlines the principles behind BIDS, the process of its development, and the technological and social infrastructure supporting its success, challenges, and lessons learned.",

      "value": "theoretical",
      "justification": "The paper primarily provides a historical and conceptual overview of the BIDS standard rather than presenting new empirical research findings.",
      "quote": "In this paper we outline the history, current status, and future directions of the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), which has become a widely accepted community-driven data standard within the neuroscience community. The goal of this exposition is to provide a written history of the events that gave rise to BIDS and outline the events leading to its establishment, which we hope will be of interest to researchers in the neuroimaging field as well as to those in other fields working to establish successful new data standards."
