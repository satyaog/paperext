    "description": "This paper investigates the differences in cortical thickness among individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and explores the genetic factors associated with these anatomical differences. Using a large and diverse sample from the EU-AIMS Longitudinal European Autism Project, the study examines neurodevelopmental differences and their potential pathophysiological mechanisms across different ASD clinical subgroups. It identifies brain regions where anatomical deviations in ASD individuals correlate with higher polygenic scores for ASD and other psychiatric conditions, linking these deviations to enriched genes in specific brain regions.",
