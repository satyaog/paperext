    "description": "The paper introduces diffusion spectral entropy (DSE) and diffusion spectral mutual information (DSMI) as noise-resilient measures for analyzing the learning process and intrinsic dimensionality of neural network representations. It applies these measures to evaluate the evolution of neural representations during training under various conditions and demonstrates their effectiveness in guiding network initialization and predicting model performance.",
