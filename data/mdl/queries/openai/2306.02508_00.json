    "description": "This paper proposes Graph Fourier MMD (GFMMD), a novel distance measure between distributions and signals on graphs. The method is analytically solved, scale invariant, and applicable to disconnected graphs. The paper demonstrates GFMMD on graph benchmark datasets and single-cell RNA-sequencing data, where it identifies meaningful gene clusters.",
