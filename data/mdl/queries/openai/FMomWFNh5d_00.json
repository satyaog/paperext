    "description": "This paper addresses the limitation of set-equivariance in slot attention for object-centric modeling in images and videos. The authors propose MESH (Minimize Entropy of Sinkhorn), a cross-attention module that enhances slot attention by combining the tiebreaking properties of unregularized optimal transport with the computational efficiency of regularized optimal transport. The proposed method is evaluated on multiple object-centric learning benchmarks, showing significant improvements over standard slot attention.",
