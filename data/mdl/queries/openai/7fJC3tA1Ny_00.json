    "description": "This paper introduces EurNet, a novel protein structure encoder designed for efficient multi-range relational modeling of protein structures. EurNet represents the protein structure as a multi-relational residue-level graph with three types of edges capturing short-range, medium-range, and long-range interactions. The core building block of EurNet is the Gated Relational Message Passing (GRMP) layer, which is both efficient and effective for this purpose. The study shows state-of-the-art performance of EurNet on Enzyme Commission (EC) and Gene Ontology (GO) protein function prediction benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance-efficiency trade-off compared to existing methods.",
