    "description": "The paper introduces a new specification called saliency-robustness to verify the relationship between Vanilla Gradient saliency maps and neural network predictions. The authors propose a method incorporating Marabou and Crown/LiRPA verifiers to address this specification. Their experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Vanilla Gradient as an explanation for certain certified outputs in neural networks, particularly using a synthetic dataset and MNIST.",
