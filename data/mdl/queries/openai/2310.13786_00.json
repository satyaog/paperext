    "description": "This article investigates the theoretical constraints of membership inference attacks (MIAs) on machine learning models. It derives statistical quantities governing the effectiveness of such attacks and demonstrates high success probability under certain conditions (e.g., non-linear regression settings with overfitting algorithms). The study also provides bounds on these quantities and explores defenses like data discretization.",
