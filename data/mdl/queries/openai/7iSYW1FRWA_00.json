    "description": "This paper presents the Neural Visual Attention (NeVA) algorithm, which imposes biologically-inspired foveated vision constraints on neural networks to generate human-like visual scanpaths. It demonstrates that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised human attention models. The NeVA method is evaluated using several well-established eye-tracking datasets, primarily focusing on the ability of the model to generate realistic scanpaths under foveated vision constraints.",
