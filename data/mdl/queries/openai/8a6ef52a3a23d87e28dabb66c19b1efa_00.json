    "description": "This paper presents a web-based decision support system designed to aid in the early detection of rheumatoid arthritis in primary care. Utilizing Sparse Fuzzy Cognitive Maps and a quantum-learning algorithm, the authors aim to address the challenges of diagnosing this condition using a limited dataset. The proposed system outperformed other machine learning models and highlights the importance of interpretabilit√© in AI for medical diagnosis.",
