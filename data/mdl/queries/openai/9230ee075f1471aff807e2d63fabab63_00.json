    "description": "This research paper investigates the simultaneous assessment of neurodegeneration in the cervical cord and brain in patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging across multiple centres. The study aims to identify microstructural changes associated with clinical impairments and explores the correlation between remote neurodegeneration and sensory deficits.",
    "type": {
      "value": "empirical",
      "justification": "The study is empirical as it involves the collection and analysis of quantitative data from MRI imaging to understand the microstructural changes in patients with DCM, as well as statistical analysis to correlate these changes with sensory impairments.",
      "quote": "We applied voxelwise analysis with a probabilistic brain/spinal cord template embedded in statistical parametric mapping (SPM-­BSC) to process multi parametric mapping (MPM)... Regression analysis was conducted to establish associations between neurodegeneration and clinical impairment."
