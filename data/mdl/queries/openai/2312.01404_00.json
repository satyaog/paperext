    "description": "The paper discusses the Asteroid Routing Problem (ARP), which focuses on optimizing spacecraft trajectories to visit a set of moving asteroids. The authors propose the first exact solution to the ARP using decision diagrams and introduce the peel-and-bound method for solving optimization problems. They also elaborate on generating heuristic search techniques for global trajectory optimization problems.",
