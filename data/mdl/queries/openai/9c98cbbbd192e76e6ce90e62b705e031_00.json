    "description": "This paper introduces mechanism sparsity regularization as a novel approach to achieve disentanglement in representation learning, leveraging the sparse dependency of latent factors. It builds on nonlinear independent component analysis (ICA) to establish a theory of identifiability, showing under what conditions latent variables can be recovered. The authors propose a VAE-based method that learns sparse causal graphical models and validate it on synthetic datasets.",
