    "description": "This paper investigates the integration of machine learning models into heuristic algorithms for solving the multicommodity capacitated fixed-charge network design problem (MCFND). It specifically uses supervised learning to predict near-optimal solutions and integrates these predictions into local search algorithms, comparing them with state-of-the-art heuristics. The paper also discusses feature engineering, dataset generation, and algorithm design for combining machine learning with combinatorial optimization.",
