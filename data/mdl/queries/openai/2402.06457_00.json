    "description": "The paper introduces V-STaR (Verification for Self-Taught Reasoners), a method that leverages both correct and incorrect solutions generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) during self-improvement processes to train a verifier for ranking the correctness of solutions. This approach improves the reasoning abilities of LLMs, achieving significant accuracy gains in benchmarks for code generation and mathematical reasoning tasks.",
