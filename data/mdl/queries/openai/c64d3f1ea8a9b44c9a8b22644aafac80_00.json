    "description": "This paper presents a deep learning approach to predict the response of individuals with primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) to disease modifying therapies (DMTs). An ensemble of multitask multilayer perceptrons was trained using clinical and MRI data to estimate conditional average treatment effects (CATE), allowing for the identification of individuals most likely to benefit from DMTs.",
