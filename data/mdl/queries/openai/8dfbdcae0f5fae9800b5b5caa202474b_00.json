    "description": "The paper presents a method for robot navigation using a sampling-based graph building process to create sparser graphs with higher navigation performance. It introduces strategies for graph maintenance to remove spurious edges and expand the graph, enhancing lifelong navigation performance. The method involves training a model using simulated data and fine-tuning it with real-world data to improve navigational accuracy over time.",
