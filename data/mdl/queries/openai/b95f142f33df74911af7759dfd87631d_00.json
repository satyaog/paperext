    "description": "This paper examines the lagged effects of price discounting on the sales of sugar-sweetened beverages by employing a time-series analysis of transaction data from a supermarket in Montreal. Using a distributed lag model, the study evaluates whether sales continue to remain higher than baseline levels after the end of discounting periods. Findings indicate that while discounting increases sales during the discount period, a significant lagged effect is primarily seen with sports and energy drinks.",
