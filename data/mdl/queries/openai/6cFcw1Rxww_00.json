    "description": "The paper proposes a novel algorithm called Local Search GFlowNets (LS-GFN) to enhance the effectiveness of Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) by leveraging local search in the object space. The approach aims to improve the training efficiency of GFlowNets by balancing exploration and exploitation through a combination of inter-mode global exploration and intra-mode local exploration. The method is applied to several benchmarks in biochemical tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in both model performance and mode diversity.",
