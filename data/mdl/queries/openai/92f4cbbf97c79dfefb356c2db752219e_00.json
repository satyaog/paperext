    "description": "This paper addresses the problem of disentangling complex data inputs into simpler factors of variation with minimal auxiliary information in supervised learning. It proposes methods to identify latent representations efficiently using an independence-constrained empirical risk minimization approach. The authors provide theoretical and empirical evidence to demonstrate the potential of their approach in achieving representation disentanglement even when auxiliary information is limited.",

      "quote": "For a class of models where auxiliary information does not ensure conditional independence, we show theoretically and experimentally that disentanglement (to a large extent) is possible even when the auxiliary information dimension is much less than the dimension of the true latent representation."
