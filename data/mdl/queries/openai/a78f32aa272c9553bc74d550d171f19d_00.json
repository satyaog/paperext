    "description": "The paper introduces and evaluates a new approach called Best Response Shaping (BRS) for multi-agent deep reinforcement learning in partially competitive environments. BRS aims to foster reciprocity-based cooperation by training an agent through an opponent that approximates the best response. The paper emphasizes the utility of BRS in improving cooperation and social welfare outcomes in games like the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma and the Coin Game, demonstrating its superiority over previous methods such as LOLA and POLA against opponents employing a Monte Carlo Tree Search strategy.",
