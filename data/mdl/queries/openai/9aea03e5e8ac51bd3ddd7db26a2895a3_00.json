    "description": "The paper introduces INTREPPPID, a deep learning model designed to enhance cross-species prediction of protein-protein interactions (PPI) by integrating orthology data and a quintuplet network architecture. This approach is aimed at improving PPI inference across different species by employing an innovative architecture and leveraging orthologue data. The study also presents a web server and software tool to facilitate the use of INTREPPPID by the broader community.",
