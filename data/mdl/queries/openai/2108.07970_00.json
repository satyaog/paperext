    "description": "This paper addresses the problem of controlling an unknown linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) system comprising multiple subsystems connected over a network. The authors aim to minimize and quantify the regret of their proposed control strategy relative to an oracle with complete system knowledge. They present a Thompson sampling-based learning algorithm that exploits the network structure to achieve a regret that scales linearly with the number of subsystems.",
