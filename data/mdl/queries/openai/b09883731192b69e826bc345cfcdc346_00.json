    "description": "This paper investigates the use of radiomics-based machine learning methods to predict survival outcomes in patients with glioblastoma who are undergoing programmed death-ligand 1 inhibition immunotherapy. Using data from a multicenter Phase II clinical trial, the authors extract MR imaging features and apply a random survival forest algorithm to develop predictive models for progression-free and overall survival. The study demonstrates that first on-treatment imaging features can significantly predict patient outcomes.",
