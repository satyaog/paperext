    "description": "This paper addresses the integrated load planning and sequencing problem (LPSP) for double-stack trains in intermodal terminals. It proposes two integer linear programming formulations to solve this problem and demonstrates their effectiveness through numerical studies. The study highlights potential reductions in container handlings and shows significant improvements in efficiency when using gantry cranes and reach stackers.",
