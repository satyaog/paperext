    "description": "This paper introduces a neuro-symbolic framework to translate informal mathematical Euclidean geometry theorems and proofs into formal, machine-verifiable statements using neuro-symbolic systems that combine domain knowledge, large language models, and automated reasoning tools. The study also constructs a benchmark, LeanEuclid, for evaluating these translations, and examines the capabilities of large language models like GPT-4 in this task.",
