    "description": "This study examines subcortical brain alterations associated with genomic copy number variants (CNVs) and their relationship to neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders (NPDs). It uses MRI data to assess volumetric and shape changes in subcortical structures among CNV carriers, evaluating correlations with disease risk and cognitive impact.",
