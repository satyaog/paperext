    "description": "This paper focuses on designing privacy-aware compression mechanisms for federated data analysis. It addresses the dual challenges of privacy and compression by creating a family of compression mechanisms that optimize the balance between utility and communication budget, while ensuring privacy. The paper introduces the Minimum Variance Unbiased (MVU) mechanism, which provides better utility-compression trade-offs under privacy constraints, and extends the mechanism to various applications, including metric differential privacy for location privacy and federated learning.",
