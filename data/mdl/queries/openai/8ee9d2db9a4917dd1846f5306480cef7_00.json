    "description": "The paper explores the disclosure of personal information in user interactions with large language models, specifically chatbots. It analyzes user conversations to identify sensitive information shared, including personally identifiable information (PII) and non-PII sensitive topics. The study uses the WildChat dataset and contributes taxonomies of tasks and sensitive topics to better understand the contexts of information sharing.",
