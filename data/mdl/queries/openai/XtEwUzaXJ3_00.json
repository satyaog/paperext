    "description": "This research introduces a data-centric machine learning method for predicting the transition dynamics of silicon atoms in a graphene lattice under the influence of an electron beam from a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM). The method trains a neural network on collected STEM data to predict transition probabilities, which can be used to automate the control of silicon atom positions in the lattice.",
