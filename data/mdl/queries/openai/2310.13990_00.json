    "description": "This paper presents a novel method, called CLINIC, for learning disentangled representations in the context of fair classification using an information-theoretic approach. The authors propose new losses to minimize mutual information between latent representations and sensitive attributes conditional to the target, without requiring additional parameters. The efficacy of CLINIC is validated through extensive experiments on several datasets, showing superior performance to existing methods.",

      "quote": "The resulting set of losses, called CLINIC, is parameter free and thus, it is easier and faster to train. CLINIC losses are studied through extensive numerical experiments by training over 2k neural networks."
