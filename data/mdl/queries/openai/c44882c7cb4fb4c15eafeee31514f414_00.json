    "description": "This paper presents a systematic framework to assess and shape the effects of AI and ML on climate change mitigation. It categorizes the impacts of ML on GHG emissions into three areas: compute-related, immediate application impacts, and system-level impacts. The paper aims to provide a roadmap for research, policy, and organizational action to align ML more closely with climate change strategies.",

      "value": "theoretical",
      "justification": "The paper introduces a systematic framework to classify and assess the impacts of machine learning on greenhouse gas emissions, rather than conducting experiments or empirical investigations.",
      "quote": "We therefore introduce a systematic framework for describing MLâ€™s effects on GHG emissions, comprising three categories: (A) compute-related impacts, (B) immediate impacts of applying ML, and (C) system-level impacts."

This can lead to challenges in terms of estimating macro-scale effects, picking up on underlying dynamics and trends, and prioritizing actions to align ML with climate strategies."
