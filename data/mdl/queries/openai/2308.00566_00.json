    "description": "This paper proposes the use of Stochastic Positional embeddings (StoP) to improve Masked Image Modeling (MIM) by incorporating location uncertainty. It involves conditioning the model on stochastic masked token positions drawn from a Gaussian distribution to reduce overfitting to location features and enhance robustness to location uncertainties. The approach is applied on I-JEPA, a state-of-the-art MIM method, leading to improved performance on various downstream tasks.",
