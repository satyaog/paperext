    "description": "The paper presents OptEmbed, a framework designed to learn an optimal embedding table for click-through rate (CTR) prediction models. The framework addresses memory usage and performance challenges in CTR models by proposing a method that prunes redundant embeddings and assigns embedding dimensions based on feature importance. OptEmbed integrates neural architecture search to optimize embedding dimensions, leading to efficient model performance. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate its effectiveness in improving model performance and reducing size.",
