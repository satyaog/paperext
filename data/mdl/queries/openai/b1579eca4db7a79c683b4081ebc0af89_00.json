    "description": "This study evaluates the global performance of two event-based surveillance systems, HealthMap and EIOS, in detecting seasonal influenza outbreaks across 24 countries. The paper investigates how these systems perform in terms of timeliness and accuracy compared to traditional surveillance models, analyzing factors influencing the variability in performance across different geographic and socioeconomic settings.",
