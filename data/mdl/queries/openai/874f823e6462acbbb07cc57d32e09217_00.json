    "description": "The paper investigates the feasibility of users estimating the level of differential privacy applied to their data in a black-box scenario, particularly focusing on local differential privacy (LDP) and R√©nyi LDP. The paper provides theoretical impossibility results and proposes a histogram-based estimator under certain conditions.",
    "type": {
      "value": "theoretical",
      "justification": "The paper mainly provides theoretical analysis and proofs related to the estimation of differential privacy.",
      "quote": "We analyze to what extent final users can infer information about the level of protection of their data when the data obfuscation mechanism is a priori unknown to them (the so-called ‚Äúblack-box\" scenario)."
