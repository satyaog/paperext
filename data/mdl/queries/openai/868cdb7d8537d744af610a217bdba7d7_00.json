    "description": "The paper introduces a new task named Reading Path Generation (RPG) designed to help researchers quickly become familiar with a new research field by generating a structured reading path. It also proposes SurveyBank, a dataset consisting of survey papers and their citation relationships, and suggests a graph-optimization-based approach for generating reading paths.",
