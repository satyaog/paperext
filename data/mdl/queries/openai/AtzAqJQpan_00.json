    "description": "This paper proposes the Surrogate Minimization (SM) algorithm which is designed to optimize large, memory-intensive neural networks by distributing their layers across multiple GPUs. The algorithm efficiently minimizes a global loss by parallelizing the training using layer-wise local losses, in conjunction with GPipe for pipelining. Theoretical convergence guarantees and empirical results on MLPs demonstrate the superiority of the SM algorithm over existing methods.",
