    "description": "This research paper discusses a novel approach for reconstructing the initial conditions of the universe using score-based generative models. By training a neural network to predict the score of the posterior distribution with simulations from the Quijote Latin Hypercube set, the researchers propose a method for efficiently sampling realizations of the early universe from present-day observations. The results indicate that the proposed method is capable of providing accurate and fast reconstructions of the early universe.",

We infer the initial density field of full high-resolution dark matter N-body simulations from the present-day density field and verify the quality of produced samples compared to the ground truth based on summary statistics."
