    "description": "This paper examines the limitations of black-box audits and highlights the advantages of white-box and outside-the-box audits in AI systems. The paper argues for the necessity of transparent and thorough audits that go beyond black-box methodologies to ensure more rigorous scrutiny and understanding of AI systems. Various issues like technical, physical, and legal safeguards for performing these audits with minimal security risks are discussed, drawing conclusions on the adequacy of different forms of access for effective AI audits.",
