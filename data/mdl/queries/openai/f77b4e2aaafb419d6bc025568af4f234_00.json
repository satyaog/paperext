    "description": "This paper explores the trade-off between context length and mixing times in reinforcement learning, particularly in environments with large context histories. Theoretical analysis is combined with examples and empirical studies using Transformer-based policies to demonstrate the impact of context length on learning efficiency and policy evaluation.",

        "quote": "This analysis underscores a key tradeoff: when we extend the context length, our policy can more effectively model non-Markovian dependencies, but this comes at the cost of potentially slower policy evaluation"
