    "description": "The research investigates the indirect consequences of anthropogenic threats on biodiversity, specifically focusing on European vertebrate food webs. It integrates data on trophic interactions among over 800 terrestrial vertebrates and their associated human-induced threats, quantifying and mapping the vulnerability of various food web components to six major threats: pollution, agricultural intensification, climate change, direct exploitation, urbanization, and invasive alien species and diseases.",
