    "description": "The paper proposes a novel global-rewards-based multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithm for vehicle dispatching in autonomous mobility on demand (AMoD) systems. This algorithm assigns rewards to agents using a counterfactual baseline to align the agents' goals with the overall system profit, thereby resolving conflicts between individual agent objectives and the global objective of the operator. The paper demonstrates significant improvements in performance over state-of-the-art MADRL algorithms that use local rewards, utilizing real-world data in various settings. Additionally, the paper provides a structural analysis highlighting benefits in vehicle balancing and demand forecasting from using global rewards.",
