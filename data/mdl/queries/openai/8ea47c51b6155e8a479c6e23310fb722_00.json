    "description": "The paper presents a novel probabilistic temporal model for image-based personalized medicine, leveraging Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (NSDE) to model continuous disease progression and treatment effects. This approach predicts both factual and counterfactual progression trajectories using MRI and tabular clinical data. The experiments were performed on a large dataset related to multiple sclerosis (MS).",
