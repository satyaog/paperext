    "description": "This paper reports efforts to identify a set of previous human evaluations in NLP suitable for a coordinated study to examine what makes human evaluations in NLP more/less reproducible. Despite the attempts, the paper highlights significant barriers to reproduction due to missing information, unresponsive authors, and experimental flaws, concluding that the majority of human evaluations in NLP are not reproducible.",
