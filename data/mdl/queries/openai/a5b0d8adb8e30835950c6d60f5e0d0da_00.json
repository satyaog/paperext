    "description": "The paper investigates the relationship between functional brain network organization and relapse risk in alcohol-dependent patients using resting-state fMRI data and graph theoretic analyses. It compares future relapsers and abstainers to healthy controls and identifies brain network characteristics associated with relapse risk over a 12-month period.",
    "type": {
      "value": "empirical",
      "justification": "The paper is empirical because it involves data collection and analysis of resting-state fMRI from patients to understand brain network organization and its association with relapse.",
      "quote": "In the present study, we analysed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) data from a sample of recently detoxified patients with AD (n = 93) who were followed up for 12 months after rsfMRI assessment."
