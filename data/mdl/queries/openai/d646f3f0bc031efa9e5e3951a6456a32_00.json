    "description": "This paper introduces ReactZyme, a benchmark for enzyme-reaction prediction. It provides an approach leveraging machine learning to predict enzyme functions based on catalyzed reactions, presenting a new perspective divergent from traditional methods. The study emphasizes the use of graph representation learning and protein language models for analyzing enzyme reaction data. The ReactZyme dataset, derived from SwissProt and Rhea databases, is proposed to test these models.",
