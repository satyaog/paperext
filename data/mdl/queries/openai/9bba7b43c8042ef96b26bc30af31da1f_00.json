    "description": "The paper introduces Inductive Graph Reinforcement Learning (IG-RL), a method based on graph-convolutional networks for scalable traffic signal control. The method can generalize to new road networks and traffic distributions without additional training, making it a scalable solution compared to previous methods. The approach is decentralized and compared to several baselines, showing superior performance in managing traffic signals in large networks, such as Manhattan with 3,971 traffic signals.",
