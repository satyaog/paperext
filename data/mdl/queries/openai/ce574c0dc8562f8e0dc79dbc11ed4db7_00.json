    "description": "This study analyzes the geographical concentration of COVID-19 cases in 16 Canadian metropolitan areas by examining various social determinants of health such as income, education, and visible minority status. The research aims to understand the extent of concentration and its variation across different cities to potentially inform more equitable public health responses.",

      "value": "empirical",
      "justification": "The study relies on data analysis of COVID-19 cases and applies statistical methods to quantify geographical concentration, which are characteristic approaches of empirical research.",
      "quote": "Methods : We used surveillance data on confirmed COVID-19 cases at the level of dissemination area. Gini (co-Gini) coefficients were calculated by CMA based on the proportion of the population in ranks of diagnosed cases and each social determinant using census data..."

Geographically-prioritized allocation of resources and services should be tailored to the local drivers of inequalities in transmission."
