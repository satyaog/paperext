    "description": "The paper introduces the Simformer, a new amortized Bayesian inference method using probabilistic diffusion models and transformer architectures to improve flexibility and efficiency in simulation-based inference scenarios. The Simformer is capable of outperforming current state-of-the-art methods in various benchmark tasks, handling both parametric and nonparametric simulators, and dealing with missing or unstructured data. It is applied to simulators from ecology, epidemiology, and neuroscience, thus demonstrating new possibilities for amortized Bayesian inference models.",
