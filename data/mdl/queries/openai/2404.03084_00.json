    "description": "The paper proposes a data-centric perspective to analyze and enhance the Teacher-Student Curriculum Learning (TSCL) framework. It utilizes cooperative game theory to explore how the teacher influences the learning process by controlling the sequence and composition of experiences presented to a learner. The paper presents a novel foundation for understanding TSCL by demonstrating its equivalence to cooperative games and evaluating its mechanics through supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and classical games experiments.",

For every problem, we estimate units a priori value (e.g., Shapley or Nowak & Radzik values) and demonstrate that these a priori values, although expensive to compute (Deng & Papadimitriou, 1994), are useful proxies to find curricula."
