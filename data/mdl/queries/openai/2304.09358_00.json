    "description": "This paper characterizes the ability of common deep learning architectures to generalize to novel 3D views of objects. It formulates this as a supervised classification task where labels correspond to unique 3D objects, and examples correspond to 2D views of these objects at different orientations. The paper presents new synthetic datasets and investigates mechanisms of 3D generalization in popular deep learning models like ResNets, VGG, and ViTs.",
