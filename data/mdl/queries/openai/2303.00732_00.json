    "description": "This paper proposes R-U-SURE, an approach for generating uncertainty-aware code suggestions using a decision-theoretic model of goal-conditioned utility with samples from a generative model acting as proxies for the user's intent. The method combines minimum-Bayes-risk decoding, dual decomposition, and decision diagrams to efficiently provide structured uncertainty summaries for code suggestions. It is implemented as an open-source library and demonstrated on several developer assistance tasks.",

      "quote": "We demonstrate R-U-SURE on three developer-assistance tasks, and show that it can be applied different user interaction patterns without retraining the model and leads to more accurate uncertainty estimates than token-probability baselines."
