    "description": "This paper studies the application of Quantile Temporal-Difference (QTD) learning in the context of reinforcement learning, specifically for value estimation tasks. The paper provides theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrating that QTD can offer superior performance for value estimation compared to classical TD learning in various scenarios, including those with high stochasticity.",

      "value": "empirical",
      "justification": "This paper combines theoretical analysis with extensive empirical studies to validate the performance of QTD algorithms.",
      "quote": "We develop the theory of QTD for mean estimation in Section 4, establishing asymptotic guarantees on the quality of the value predictions that the algorithm makes. Second, we conduct further empirical investigations in Section 5, aiming to develop a more nuanced understanding of the relative performance of QTD and TD in practice."
