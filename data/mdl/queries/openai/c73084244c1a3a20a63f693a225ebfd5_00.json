    "description": "This paper focuses on adapting, translating, and linguistically validating an existing Patient-Reported Experience Measure (PREM) developed in the UK for use in a Canadian pediatric outpatient setting. The study involves methodological processes like qualitative testing and cognitive interviews with children and young people, contributing to patient-centered care in pediatric healthcare.",
    "type": {
      "value": "empirical",
      "justification": "The paper uses empirical methods such as think-aloud testing, cognitive testing, and translation processes involving real participants to adapt the PREM tool.",
      "quote": "Methods: A qualitative design was used, involving CYP and their parents/caregivers. Phase 1 entailed the English survey adaptation using think-aloud testing, revision, and cognitive testing."

        "value": "Patient-Centered Care",
        "justification": "The paper's primary focus is on adapting and validating a tool that enhances patient-centered care by capturing patient-reported experiences.",
        "quote": "Conclusions: This study reports the development of the first Canadian PREM specifically tailored to children. By incorporating the perspectives and preferences of CYP in clinical practice, this approach has the potential to amplify the delivery of patient-centered care for this vulnerable population and ensure that the needs and voices of CYP are acknowledged."
