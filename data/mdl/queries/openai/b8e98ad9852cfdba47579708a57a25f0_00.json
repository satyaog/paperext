    "description": "The paper evaluates a data-driven model for automated deep brain stimulation (DBS) parameter setting to improve motor symptoms control while considering stimulation-induced side-effects. It discusses the potential of computational models and algorithm-driven optimization in DBS programming and the need for future research to enhance the precision and applicability of these methods.",
