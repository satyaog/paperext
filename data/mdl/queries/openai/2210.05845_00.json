    "description": "The paper introduces a new Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm called Contrastive Retrospection (ConSpec). ConSpec uses offline contrastive learning to identify critical steps within tasks to facilitate rapid learning and generalization. It can be added to any existing RL algorithm to enhance credit assignment by recognizing and rewarding critical steps leading to success. The algorithm improves learning across various RL tasks including grid-world, Atari, and 3D environments, and demonstrates zero-shot out-of-distribution generalization.",
