    "description": "This paper explores the approximate minimization problem for weighted tree automata, drawing inspiration from spectral methods used for weighted automata on strings. It introduces the concept of singular value tree automata, providing bounds on approximation quality and examining the complexities involved in computing this canonical form. The paper also connects iterative computation methods, like fixed point iteration and Newtonâ€™s method, to the problem, offering new insights.",
