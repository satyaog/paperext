    "description": "The paper presents GLMsingle, a toolbox designed to enhance the accuracy of single-trial fMRI response estimates. It integrates techniques for improving general linear model (GLM) beta estimates, such as custom hemodynamic response function (HRF) fitting, noise regression through cross-validation, and beta regularization via ridge regression. The paper demonstrates the toolbox's effectiveness using the Natural Scenes Dataset, BOLD5000, and StudyForrest auditory dataset, showcasing its potential for broader applications in cognitive and systems neuroscience.",

      "quote": "We demonstrate that GLMsingle: (i) helps decorrelate response estimates between trials nearby in time; (ii) enhances representational similarity between subjects within and across datasets; and (iii) boosts one-­versus-­many decoding of visual stimuli."
