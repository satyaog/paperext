      "value": "More Than Meets the Eye: Art Engages the Social Brain",
      "justification": "The title 'More Than Meets the Eye: Art Engages the Social Brain' clearly reflects the focus of the paper on how art interacts with social brain dynamics.",

    "description": "This paper explores the hypothesis that art engages the social brain. It discusses the neural architecture involved in viewing artworks, proposing an \"artistic brain connectome.\" The paper emphasizes the importance of recognizing art as a social construct and its implications for mental health and dementia care.",
    "type": {
      "value": "theoretical",
      "justification": "The paper is theoretical as it proposes a model for understanding how art engages the social brain and discusses its potential implications without presenting specific empirical data.",
      "quote": "We present a prima facie case for visual art as a social brain phenomenon, drawing pre-eminently on evidence derived from the social brain connectome to propose an “artistic brain connectome.”"

        "justification": "The primary research field is Neuroscience, given the focus on brain networks, neural architecture, and how these relate to art engagement and social cognition.",
        "quote": "We propose that artworks may be candidate “probes” of social brain operation with relevance extending widely beyond art."
