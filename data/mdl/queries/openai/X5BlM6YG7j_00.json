    "description": "The paper presents a method called Object-centric Compositional Imagination (OCIM) which leverages object-centric inductive biases to achieve compositional generalization in visual reasoning tasks. The method decomposes visual reasoning tasks into a series of primitives applied to objects and recomposes them to generate new imaginary tasks.",
