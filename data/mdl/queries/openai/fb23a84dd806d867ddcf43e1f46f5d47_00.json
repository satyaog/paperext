    "description": "This paper explores implicit meta-learning within language models, demonstrating how language models can identify and internalize reliable data indicators. The study involves fine-tuning pretrained language models on datasets with synthetic indicators, discovering that models internalize content from perceived reliable sources more effectively. The paper investigates this phenomenon across various models and datasets, proposing hypotheses on its underlying mechanisms and discussing its implications for AI capabilities and safety.",
