Additionally, using public datasets provides a baseline for researchers to compare their approaches. The release of large public datasets has been known to propel research in ML (Gauen et al., 2017). For instance, the release of ImageNet datasets (Deng et al., 2009) led to the birth of new neural architectures such as AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2017) and VGG (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014).
