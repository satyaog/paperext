    "description": "The paper discusses the importance of social interaction in AI, proposing a framework to integrate social learning mechanisms from neuroscience to enhance AI's cognitive abilities. It highlights the omission of social interactions in current AI models, comparing it to \"dark matter,\" a critical but overlooked constituent of intelligence.",

      "value": "theoretical",
      "justification": "The paper introduces a theoretical framework to integrate social learning in AI based on cognitive and social neuroscience insights, without mentioning empirical experimentation or data analysis.",
      "quote": "This article introduces a three-axis framework indicating how AI can be informed by biological examples of social learning mechanisms."
