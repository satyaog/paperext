    "description": "The paper introduces a framework for automatically structuring and training deep neural surrogates for stochastic simulators with unbounded randomness. The surrogates retain the structure of the simulators and enable faster simulations and posterior inference. The framework is particularly suited for simulators with an arbitrary number of random variables, focusing on applications like materials quality testing and Bayesian inference with probabilistic programming.",
