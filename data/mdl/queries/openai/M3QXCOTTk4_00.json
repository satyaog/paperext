    "description": "The paper investigates a phenomenon in deep reinforcement learning where a diverse ensemble of data-sharing agents, typically used for exploration, can lead to reduced performance for individual ensemble members compared to single-agent training. This is attributed to off-policy learning challenges and the low proportion of self-generated data for each ensemble member. The paper introduces a method called Cross-Ensemble Representation Learning (CERL) to mitigate the performance loss and improve exploration outcomes.",

We verify our hypothesis in the Arcade Learning Environment (Bellemare et al., 2012) with the Bootstrapped DQN (Osband et al., 2016) algorithm and the Gym MuJoCo benchmark (Towers et al., 2023) with an ensemble SAC (Haarnoja et al., 2018a) algorithm."
