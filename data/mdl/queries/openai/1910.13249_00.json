    "description": "The paper addresses the challenge of creating a navigation assistant for blind and visually-impaired (BVI) individuals. It introduces SEVN, a sidewalk simulation environment, and explores the performance of a neural network-based navigation agent trained using reinforcement learning algorithms.",

      "value": "empirical",
      "justification": "The paper involves the creation of a simulation environment and conducts experiments to evaluate the performance of reinforcement learning algorithms for navigation tasks.",
      "quote": "This work introduces SEVN, a sidewalk simulation environment and a neural network-based approach to creating a navigation agent. SEVN contains panoramic images with labels for house numbers, doors, and street name signs, and formulations for several navigation tasks. We study the performance of an RL algorithm (PPO) in this setting."
