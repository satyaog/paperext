    "description": "This article presents a study on the application of supervised latent factor modeling to identify transcriptomic modules specific to cell types in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The research highlights the roles of these modules in distinguishing between healthy and AD-affected cells, particularly focusing on the contributions of microglia and other glial cells to AD pathophysiology. The study uses a dataset of single-nucleus RNA sequencing to explore the predictive nature of these transcriptomic modules, emphasizing gene set enrichment analysis to discover biologically relevant processes.",
