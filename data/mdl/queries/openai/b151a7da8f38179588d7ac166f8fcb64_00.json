    "description": "The paper proposes a framework combining local-scale food web energy flux approaches and large-scale biodiversity models to evaluate ecosystem functions and Nature's contributions to people (NCP) at macroecological scales. This framework aims to upscale ecosystem functions, assess vulnerability of flux-related NCP to climate change, and support multiscale mitigation policies.",
