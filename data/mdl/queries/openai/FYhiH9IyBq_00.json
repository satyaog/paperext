    "description": "The paper introduces Cone-Traced SuperSampling (CTSS), an efficient spatial antialiasing technique that complements the sphere tracing algorithm for Signed Distance Field (SDF) rendering. CTSS reduces computational overhead while providing high-quality antialiasing comparable to 4x-8x supersampling.",
