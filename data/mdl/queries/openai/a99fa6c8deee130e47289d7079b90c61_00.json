    "description": "The paper discusses a modification to the classic cop and robber game on graphs, introducing a new light-dismantling procedure to address issues with a fast robber. It proposes a monotonic winning strategy for a cop on undergrounded graphs, a generalization of classical dismantlable graphs.",

      "justification": "The paper primarily deals with theoretical concepts in graph theory and strategies for games on graphs, without mentioning empirical experiments or data.",
