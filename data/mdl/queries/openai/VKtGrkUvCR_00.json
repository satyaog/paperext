    "description": "This paper analyzes the average-case complexity of optimization algorithms on convex quadratic problems by examining the concentration of eigenvalues. It introduces the Generalized Chebyshev Method, optimal under specific eigenvalue concentration assumptions, and establishes a universality result for Nesterov's method, showing its near-optimality under average-case conditions.",
