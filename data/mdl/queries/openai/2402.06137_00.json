    "description": "This paper revisits the differential privacy analysis of the Above Threshold and Report Noisy Max mechanisms when instantiated with Gaussian noise. It shows that pure differential privacy guarantees can be achieved under certain conditions, and introduces a meta-algorithm for adaptive composition called Filtered Self-Reporting Composition (FSRC). The paper provides both theoretical analyses and empirical experiments with applications to mobility and energy consumption datasets, demonstrating that these methods can achieve competitive utility and require less hyper-parameter tuning.",
