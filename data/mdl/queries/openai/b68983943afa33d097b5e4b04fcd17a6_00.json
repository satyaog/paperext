    "description": "The paper introduces 'commonality' as a new metric for evaluating recommender systems that aim to enhance cultural citizenship, focusing on shared cultural experiences rather than just personalized recommendations.

      "justification": "The paper includes an empirical comparison of recommendation algorithms using the proposed commonality metric alongside existing metrics.",
