    "description": "This paper addresses the challenges of estimating social influence from observational data by introducing the Poisson Influence Factorization (PIF) method. It formalizes social influence as a causal effect and provides a methodology to infer it despite unobserved confounders. PIF is tested using semi-synthetic simulations and real data from Last.fm, showing it can accurately determine social influence.",
