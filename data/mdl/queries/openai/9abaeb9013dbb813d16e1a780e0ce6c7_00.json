    "description": "The paper introduces the Evidence-Centered Benchmark Design (ECBD), a framework adapted from educational assessments, to provide a systematic way of designing NLP benchmarks. ECBD breaks down the process into five modules and aims to enhance validity in benchmark measurements by encouraging thorough documentation and justification of design decisions.",

      "quote": "To illustrate ECBD’s usage for benchmark analysis, we organize these questions into a worksheet (Appendix A) and apply it to three different benchmarks: BoolQ (Clark et al., 2019), SuperGLUE (Wang et al., 2019), and HELM (Liang et al., 2022)."
