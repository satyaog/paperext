    "description": "This research paper proposes mechanism sparsity regularization as a principle for disentanglement in machine learning models. The authors introduce a method to induce disentanglement by simultaneously learning the latent factors and the sparse causal graphical model that explains them. They develop a nonparametric identifiability theory to formalize this principle and guarantee partial disentanglement by enforcing sparse temporal dependencies and sparse influence from auxiliary variables.",

      "quote": "We propose a representation learning method that induces disentanglement by simultaneously learning the latent factors and the sparse causal graphical model that explains them. We develop a nonparametric identifiability theory that formalizes this principle and shows that the latent factors can be recovered by regularizing the learned causal graph to be sparse."
