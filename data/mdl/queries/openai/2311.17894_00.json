    "description": "This paper introduces a machine learning approach to determine the transition dynamics of silicon atoms on a single layer of carbon atoms when stimulated by the electron beam of a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM). The method uses data-centric techniques to predict transition probabilities and automates the manipulation of silicon atoms.",
