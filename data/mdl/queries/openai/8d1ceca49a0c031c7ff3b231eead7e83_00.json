    "description": "The paper introduces JANOS, a novel framework that integrates predictive modeling with prescriptive analytics through optimization. The framework supports predictive models such as linear regression, logistic regression, and neural networks (NNs) with ReLU activation functions, embedding these models as constraints in optimization problems. This integration aids in addressing complex decision-making problems by automating the transcription of predictive models into mixed integer programming (MIP) formulations. Demonstrations and evaluations of JANOS are provided, focusing on its efficiency and the improvements it offers in decision-making processes.",
