    "description": "The paper presents AICOM-MP, a state-of-the-art AI-based monkeypox detection system designed to operate in resource-constrained environments. The system is intended to improve healthcare access in less developed countries by integrating into Autonomous Mobile Clinics (AMCs). This includes constructing and open-sourcing the AICOM-MP dataset and hosting the system as a web service for universal access. The methodology developed also provides a general framework for creating health AI technologies for various diseases beyond monkeypox.",
