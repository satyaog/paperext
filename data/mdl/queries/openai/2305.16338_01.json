    "description": "This paper addresses inefficiencies in LLM-based decision-making agents related to the forgetting phenomenon, where models forget previous tasks when learning new ones. The authors propose using an internal working memory module to store, blend, and retrieve information for different downstream tasks, improving training efficiency and generalization. They introduce Decision Transformers with Memory (DT-Mem) and evaluate it on Atari games and Meta-World environments, showing improved performance over existing methods.",
