    "description": "The paper presents neuroconnectionism as a cohesive large-scale research programme centered around artificial neural networks (ANNs) for modeling brain computations. It reviews past and present neuroconnectionist projects, their challenges, and argues that this approach is highly progressive in generating novel insights into cognitive neuroscience.",
    "type": {
      "value": "theoretical",
      "justification": "The paper mainly deals with theoretical aspects of using ANNs to model brain computations and discusses its conceptual framework, underlying computational methods, and philosophical grounding.",
      "quote": "We propose that arguing about the successes and failures of a restricted set of current ANNs is the wrong approach to assess the promise of neuroconnectionism. Instead, we take inspiration from the philosophy of science, and in particular from Lakatos, who showed that the core of scientific research programmes is often not directly falsifiable, but should be assessed by its capacity to generate novel insights."
