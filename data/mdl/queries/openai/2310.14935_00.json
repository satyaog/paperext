    "description": "This paper explores the application of causal machine learning techniques to single-cell genomics. It delves into the challenges and methodologies for applying causal approaches to understand gene regulation, disease progression, and cellular development from a causal perspective. It also identifies open problems such as generalizing to unseen environments, learning interpretable models, and modeling the dynamics of biological mechanisms.",
