    "description": "This paper analyzes the dynamics of large batch stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGD+M) on least squares problems in high-dimensional settings. It focuses on the convergence behavior of SGD+M and introduces a stability measurement called the implicit conditioning ratio (ICR). The study provides insights into the linear convergence rates of SGD+M under different batch size conditions.",
