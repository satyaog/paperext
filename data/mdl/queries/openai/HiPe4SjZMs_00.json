    "description": "This paper investigates incorporating local optimizers that compute multiple updates into a learned optimization framework. The goal is to potentially create more efficient local SGD algorithms. The study demonstrates that learned optimizers can outperform local SGD and its variants while maintaining communication efficiency, and these optimizers can generalize to new datasets and architectures.",
