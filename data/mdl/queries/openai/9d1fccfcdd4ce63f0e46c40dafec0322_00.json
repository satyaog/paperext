    "description": "This paper proposes an estimation method for the Generalized Stochastic Preference choice model, which is capable of capturing both rational and irrational customer behaviors. The paper discusses how to use partially-ranked preferences to efficiently model these behaviors from transaction data and assesses the predictive accuracy of the proposed approach using extensive experiments.",
