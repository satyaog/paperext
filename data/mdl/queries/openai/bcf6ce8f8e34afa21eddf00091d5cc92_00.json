    "description": "The paper evaluates the face and content validity of a virtual reality (VR) software designed for pediatric trauma education. It focuses on the use of VR to enhance trauma skills and decrease education costs. The study involved multiple physicians testing the software and found it valuable, especially for non-technical skills training. While the VR was seen as realistic and effective, some users experienced discomfort during the simulation.",
