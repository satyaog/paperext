    "description": "This paper discusses the creation and validation of a large-scale, data-driven, biophysically detailed model of the rat primary somatosensory cortex (S1), primarily focused on its non-barrel regions. It addresses the integration of anatomical and physiological data to simulate neural activity, calibrate extrinsic inputs, and validate the model against in vivo data from rodent cortex. The study also includes in silico experimentation to emulate laboratory conditions and provide predictions about cortical processing.",
