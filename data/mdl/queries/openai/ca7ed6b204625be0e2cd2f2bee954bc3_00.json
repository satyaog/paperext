    "description": "The paper proposes a novel U-Net-based structure to predict intervertebral disc locations by integrating image shape information to enhance the model's learning capabilities. A permutation invariant 'look once' model is suggested to improve candidate recovery by reducing false positives. The method demonstrates superior performance on the Spine Generic public multi-center dataset.",
