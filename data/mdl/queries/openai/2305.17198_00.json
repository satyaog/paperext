    "description": "This paper addresses the offline multi-agent reinforcement learning coordination problem by identifying the deficiencies of current model-free methods and proposing a model-based solution called MOMA-PPO. The new method generates synthetic interaction data, allowing agents to coordinate effectively and fine-tune their policies, significantly outperforming existing methods.",
