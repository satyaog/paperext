    "description": "This paper proposes the use of GFlowNets to tackle NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems by designing Markov decision processes (MDPs) and efficient training techniques for conditional GFlowNets. The approach aims to leverage the capabilities of GFlowNets to find high-quality solutions efficiently by sampling from the solution space sequentially. The empirical performance of GFlowNets is validated through extensive experiments on various combinatorial optimization tasks, both synthetic and realistic.",
