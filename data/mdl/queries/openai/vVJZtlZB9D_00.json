    "description": "The paper presents a unifying framework that generalizes the Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (SLTH) to equivariant neural networks. It provides theoretical proofs for the existence of winning tickets for such networks, ensuring that they can match the performance of trained target networks through pruning. The framework is applicable to various types of equivariant networks, including CNNs, E(2)-steerable CNNs, and permutation equivariant networks.",
