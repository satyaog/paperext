    "description": "This paper examines the reliability of the Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) similarity metric in comparing learned neural representations in neural networks. It provides a theoretical analysis of CKA sensitivity to transformations and empirically demonstrates situations where CKA gives counter-intuitive results. The paper also explores methods to manipulate CKA values without significantly altering the functional behavior of neural networks.",
