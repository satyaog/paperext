    "description": "This paper proposes an ensemble diversification framework that leverages Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) to mitigate shortcut learning and bias in deep neural networks. By generating synthetic counterfactuals that break spurious correlations present in the training data, the authors aim to enhance model diversity via ensemble disagreement. The study demonstrates improved generalization and diversification performance on datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results in bias mitigation without the need for additional supervised signals.",
