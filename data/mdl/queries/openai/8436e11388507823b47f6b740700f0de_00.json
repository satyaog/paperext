    "description": "This paper introduces GenRL, a framework for training embodied agents that can generalize across multiple tasks using visual or language prompts without explicit reward signals. The framework integrates large vision-language models with generative world models, enabling generalization in reinforcement learning by aligning latent spaces and using imagination for learning. The study emphasizes learning from unimodal data and data-free policy learning, promoting scalability and flexibility in embodied reinforcement learning tasks.",
