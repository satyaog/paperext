    "description": "The paper introduces the ProtST framework, which aims to enhance protein sequence pre-training and understanding by integrating biomedical texts. It proposes a new dataset called ProtDescribe, which pairs protein sequences with textual descriptions of their properties. The framework uses multimodal learning tasks, including unimodal mask prediction, multimodal representation alignment, and multimodal mask prediction, to improve the representation power of protein language models (PLMs). The enhanced PLMs are shown to perform well on various downstream tasks, including supervised learning and zero-shot prediction.",
