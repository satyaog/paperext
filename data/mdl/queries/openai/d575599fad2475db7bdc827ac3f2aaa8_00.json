    "description": "This paper focuses on the estimation of noise covariance matrices in multi-task high-dimensional linear regression models. It leverages multi-task elastic-net and multi-task lasso estimators and corrects the bias in the squared residual matrix to propose a novel estimator of the noise covariance. This estimator is claimed to converge at a rate comparable to an oracle estimator, and the paper presents extensive simulations to demonstrate its efficacy.",
