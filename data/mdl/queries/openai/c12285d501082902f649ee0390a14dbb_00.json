    "description": "This paper describes a protocol for a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the Smart About Meds (SAM) mobile application. The application aims to improve medication adherence among patients discharged from hospitals by integrating features like pharmacist monitoring and patient notification of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs). The study involves 3250 adult patients, stratified and randomized, with outcomes measured over a 90-day follow-up period.",
