    "description": "This paper introduces MATES, a deep-learning model designed to accurately quantify transposable elements (TEs) at specific loci using single-cell sequencing data. It aims to improve upon existing methods that often fail to provide detailed locus-specific quantification due to multi-mapping challenges. MATES leverages a deep neural network to allocate reads to specific TE loci by considering the genomic context, showing better performance over traditional methods in various datasets.",
