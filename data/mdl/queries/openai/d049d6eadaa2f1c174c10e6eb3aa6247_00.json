    "description": "This research investigates the impact of different levels of Myelin Basic Protein (MBP) mRNA on the dimensions, architecture, plasticity of the myelin sheath, and the density of glial cells. By using enhancer-edited mouse models with varied MBP mRNA levels, the study explores the relationship between molecular regulation and Myelin sheath development across the lifespan of mice.",
