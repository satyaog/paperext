    "description": "This paper addresses the challenge of allocating human operators to assist multiple semi-autonomous robots. By modeling the problem as a Restless Multi-Armed Bandit (RMAB) problem and using a Whittle index heuristic, the researchers present a scalable decision support system that optimizes operator allocation in multi-robot systems.",
