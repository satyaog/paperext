    "description": "This paper presents a method called simulation-free score and flow matching ([SF]2 M), which solves the problem of inferring stochastic dynamics from unpaired samples taken from arbitrary source and target distributions. It generalizes the score-matching loss for diffusion models and flow matching loss for continuous normalizing flows. The method avoids the need to simulate learned stochastic processes during training, making it more efficient and accurate. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of [SF]2 M on both synthetic and real-world datasets, particularly in the context of modeling cell dynamics from snapshot data.",
