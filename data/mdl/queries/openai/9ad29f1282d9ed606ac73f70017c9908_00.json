    "description": "The paper introduces a videogame controller designed for use in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). The controller is constructed using 3D-printed and commercially available parts. It was evaluated against a non-MRI compatible controller and showed reliable button press accuracies and minimal effect on fMRI and MEG data quality. The documentation and build instructions have been released under an Open Source Hardware license to facilitate reproducibility and further improvements by the research community.",
