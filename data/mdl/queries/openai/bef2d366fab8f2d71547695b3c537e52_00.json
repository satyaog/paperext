    "description": "This paper explores the use of invariant representation learning to enhance neural-net-based classifiers for the detection of non-QCD signal jets, specifically in the context of reducing QCD backgrounds in jet physics. By employing classification-based anomaly detection frameworks, the study demonstrates potential improvements in tagging efficiency and significance through supervised Standard Model jet classifiers, leveraging inductive biases, and data-augmented mass-invariance. It discusses various models, datasets, and training methodologies, examining their effects on out-of-distribution detection and background rejection in high-energy physics experiments.",
