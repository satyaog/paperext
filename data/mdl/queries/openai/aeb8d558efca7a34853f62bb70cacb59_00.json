    "description": "As the biomedical community produces increasingly complex and high-dimensional datasets, there is a need for more sophisticated computational tools to extract biological insights. This paper presents Multiscale PHATE, a method that applies to a COVID-19 dataset to predict patient disease outcomes more accurately by learning and visualizing data at multiple levels of granularity.",
