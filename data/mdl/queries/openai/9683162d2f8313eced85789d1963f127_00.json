    "description": "This paper presents PyNM, a lightweight Python tool designed to facilitate and implement Normative Modeling (NM), making it accessible and easy to use. Normative Modeling allows for the analysis of individual deviations from normative ranges within a population, offering an alternative approach to traditional case-control methods in neuroimaging and psychiatry.",
