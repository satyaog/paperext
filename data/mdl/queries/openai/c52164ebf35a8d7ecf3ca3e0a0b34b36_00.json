    "description": "The paper introduces ET-Flow, a deep learning model designed to generate low-energy 3D molecular conformations from molecular graphs. It challenges existing methods by incorporating equivariance and flow matching, offering a scalable and efficient approach that improves precision and physical validity while reducing the computational burden. ET-Flow's architecture integrates components from TorchMD-NET and adopts a harmonic prior, showing significant improvements over existing models in empirical evaluations on datasets such as GEOM-DRUGS.",
