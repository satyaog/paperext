    "description": "The paper explores the concept of integrating Bayesian principles into deep learning by rethinking traditional methods. It introduces the notion of 'implicitly Bayesian' prediction rules, which are characterized as Bayesian without explicitly using priors and posteriors. The paper proposes a measure to evaluate how closely a prediction strategy aligns with being implicitly Bayesian and evaluates several prediction strategies using this approach. Theoretical arguments are provided, demonstrating that non-implicitly Bayesian agents can be exploited in adversarial settings.",
