Using diffusion MRI and multivariate statistical methods, the study explores multi-tract multi-symptom relationships to better understand the complexities of concussion impacts, presenting an approach that identifies specific structural and symptomatic relationships rather than one-to-one symptom-connectivity patterns.",
