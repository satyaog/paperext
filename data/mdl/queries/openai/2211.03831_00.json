    "description": "This paper introduces Multi-Head Routing (MHR), an extension of Polytropon (Poly), which enhances parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for cross-task generalization. The model is designed to provide expressivity by combining blocks from different adapters during pre-training and few-shot adaptation. The paper also explores several variants of MHR, such as MHR-z and MHR-µ, and evaluates their performance on the T0 and Super-Natural Instructions datasets.",
