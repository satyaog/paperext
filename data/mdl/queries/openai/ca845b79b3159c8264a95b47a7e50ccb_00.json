    "description": "This paper investigates the application of quantization techniques during the pre-training phase of transformer language models to increase efficiency. The study systematically applies linear quantization to various components such as weights, activations, gradients, and optimizer states, primarily using 4 and 8 bits. The goal is to achieve high training efficiency while retaining model performance. The results are analyzed for their effects on memory savings, training stability, and performance, and a comprehensive quantization strategy is proposed.",
