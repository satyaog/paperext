    "description": "This paper introduces a novel method for estimating unknown population sizes using the hypergeometric distribution, particularly in situations where sample elements are not independent and where sampling is significant compared to population size. The authors use a variational autoencoder framework to address this challenge and apply their method to applications in natural language processing and genomics.",
