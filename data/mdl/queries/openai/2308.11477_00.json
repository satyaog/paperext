    "description": "This paper proposes improvements to a column-generation-based heuristic approach for training decision trees, initially developed by Firat et al. (2020). The improvements include a modified subproblem model, data-dependent constraints used as cutting planes, an optimization model for generating these cutting planes, and a preprocessing and initialization routine. The results show that these modifications lead to faster training and better scalability for decision tree learning.",
