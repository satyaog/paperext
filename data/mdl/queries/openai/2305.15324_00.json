    "description": "The paper focuses on the importance of evaluating general-purpose AI models for extreme risks, including both dangerous capabilities and the propensity to misuse these capabilities. It proposes a framework for integrating such evaluations into AI governance to ensure responsible training, deployment, and security of AI systems.",

      "value": "empirical",
      "justification": "The paper conducts an empirical assessment by proposing a framework for model evaluation and lays out a series of steps and criteria to empirically evaluate AI models for dangerous capabilities and alignment.",
      "quote": "We explain why model evaluation is critical for addressing extreme risks. Developers must be able to identify dangerous capabilities (through “dangerous capability evaluations”) and the propensity of models to apply their capabilities for harm (through “alignment evaluations”)."
