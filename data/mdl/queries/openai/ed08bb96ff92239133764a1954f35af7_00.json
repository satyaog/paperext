    "description": "The paper presents a study on forest change detection and biomass monitoring in Canada using Sentinel-2 and Landsat satellite data. It introduces the TIIC algorithm for near-real-time tracking of stand-replacing forest changes and quantifies AGB dynamics within the 2019 growing season. The study highlights the integration of satellite data for improved temporal accuracy in detecting forest disturbances.",
