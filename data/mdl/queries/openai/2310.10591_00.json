    "description": "This paper presents a framework for interpreting and controlling large-scale pre-trained vision foundation models like CLIP through text explanations. The framework enables understanding the reasoning processes of these models by retrieving natural language explanations for latent tokens without additional model training or data collection. The authors also demonstrate how to edit the model behavior using these interpretations to improve robustness against biases and spurious correlations.",
