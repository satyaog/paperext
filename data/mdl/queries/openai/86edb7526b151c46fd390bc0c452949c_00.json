    "description": "This paper aims to replicate previous findings regarding the neural correlates of affective mentalizing in patients with schizophrenia and investigate its possible association with impaired domain-general cognition, particularly verbal intelligence. The study involved functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and cognitive assessments on patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls from German and Australian cohorts.",

      "value": "empirical",
      "justification": "The paper involves experimentation and data collection through fMRI and cognitive assessments to gather evidence.",
      "quote": "We analyzed imaging data from two large multi-centric German studies including 64 patients, 64 matched controls and a separate cohort of 300 healthy subjects, as well as an independent Australian study including 64 patients and 46 controls."
