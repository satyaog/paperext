    "description": "The paper introduces a method called 'TITRATED' to fine-tune a foundation model of human driving behavior, which was initially trained using the INTERACTION dataset, to adapt it for deployment in new locations like CARLA simulator. The primary goal is to minimize infractions such as collisions and off-road driving. This is achieved through a process called amortized inference, which generates infraction-free trajectories that the model is further trained upon, significantly reducing infraction rates by 76-86%.",
