    "description": "The paper explores how recurrent neural networks (RNNs) process and maintain naturalistic object information in working memory through N-back tasks, contrasting this with traditional categorical inputs. It suggests that both task-relevant and irrelevant information are simultaneously encoded, and highlights the task-specific nature of RNN subspaces, particularly in gated RNNs like GRU and LSTM. It emphasizes the use of chronological memory subspaces in RNNs to handle overlapping object features across tasks.",
