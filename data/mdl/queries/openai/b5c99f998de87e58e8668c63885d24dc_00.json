    "description": "This paper proposes a general-purpose approach using continuous-time neural differential equations to predict temperature and HVAC power usage in buildings. It suggests a model to address the challenge of deploying adaptive smart temperature controllers combined with demand response programs, aiming to control the temperature setpoint for limiting HVAC power consumption while ensuring user comfort. The approach is mainly data-driven, using metering data, and can adapt to incorporate prior knowledge about building physics. The paper discusses in detail the performance of continuous-time models in comparison to discrete-time counterparts in HVAC control applications.",
