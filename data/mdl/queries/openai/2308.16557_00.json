    "description": "This paper introduces MuTAP, a technique that employs pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve the effectiveness of test cases generated for software testing. By augmenting prompts with surviving mutants from mutation testing, MuTAP enhances the bug-revealing capabilities of test cases. The approach was shown to outperform state-of-the-art automated test generation tools in multiple benchmarks.",
