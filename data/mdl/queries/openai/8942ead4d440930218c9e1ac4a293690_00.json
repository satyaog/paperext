    "description": "The paper evaluates the use of early-stage face processing speed, specifically N170 latency, as a clinical stratification factor for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). It investigates the correlation between N170 latency and socialization outcomes, brain responses via fMRI, and polygenic scores to improve strategies for personalized therapies for ASD.",

      "value": "empirical",
      "justification": "The study involves experiments and data analysis, including measuring N170 latency in individuals with ASD and comparing it to controls using empirical methods like EEG and fMRI.",
      "quote": "We sought to validate neural responses to faces as a potential stratification factor in ASD by measuring neural (electroencephalography) responses to faces (critical in social interaction) in N = 436 children and adults with and without ASD."
