    "description": "The paper introduces GRAPH TEXT, a novel framework that translates graphs into natural language to perform graph reasoning using Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework constructs a graph-syntax tree for each graph, incorporating node attributes and inter-node relationships to generate graph text sequences. These sequences enable LLMs to tackle graph tasks as text generation tasks. The framework offers training-free graph reasoning using in-context learning, potentially surpassing supervised graph neural networks. It also facilitates interactive graph reasoning with natural language communication between humans and LLMs.",
