    "description": "The paper investigates the impact of personalization in the phrasing of questions within intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) and the effect such personalization has on student learning outcomes. By creating question variants suitable for students at different levels of proficiency and conducting an experimental A/B test, the authors demonstrate how adapting questions affects learning gains.",

      "value": "empirical",
      "justification": "The study involves experimental A/B testing with real students to evaluate the impact of personalized question phrasing within an ITS, indicating it is empirical.",
      "quote": "We show that generating versions of the questions suitable for students at different levels of subject proficiency improves student learning gains, using variants written by a domain expert and an experimental A/B test."
