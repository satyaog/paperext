    "description": "This paper investigates the potential of immunotherapy to address the heterogeneity of the surfaceome in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Through a comprehensive analysis of the surface proteome of diverse primary human AML specimens, it identifies several antigens and leukemia stem cell markers. The study leverages proteomics and transcriptomics to uncover AML subgroup-specific antigens and proposes potential therapeutic antibodies for targeting AML heterogeneity.",

      "quote": "Here, to identify potential targets for immunotherapeutic intervention, we analyze the surface proteome of 100 genetically diverse primary human AML specimens for the identification of cell surface proteins and conduct single-cell transcriptome analyses on a subset of these specimens to assess antigen expression at the sub-population level."
