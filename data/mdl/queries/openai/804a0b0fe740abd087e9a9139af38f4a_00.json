      "value": "Processing visual ambiguity in fractal patterns: Pareidolia as a sign of creativity",

    },
    "description": "The paper explores how highly creative individuals perceive forms in ambiguous visual stimuli, specifically focusing on the concept of pareidolia as a representation of creativity. It investigates the correlation between creativity and the ability to perceive pareidolic images using fractal patterns of varying dimensions and contrasts as stimuli.",
    "type": {
      "value": "empirical",
      "justification": "The study involves the collection and analysis of data from tasks where participants identify forms in visual stimuli, thereby providing empirical insights into the relationship between creativity and perception.",
      "quote": "Here, we examine the perceptual aspect of creativity by asking whether creative individuals are more likely to perceive recognizable forms in ambiguous stimuli –a phenomenon known as pareidolia."

        "quote": "Creativity is a highly valued and beneficial skill that empirical research typically probes using ‘‘divergent thinking’’ (DT) tasks such as problem solving and novel idea generation."
