    "description": "The paper discusses the use of the PEARLS Healthcare Debriefing Tool to enhance non-technical skills in trauma courses. It evaluates this tool using a nominal group technique and suggests that the PEARLS strategies are effective for fostering non-technical skills. The study emphasizes the importance of structured debriefing to improve communication and leadership in trauma settings, proposing a new debriefing card for trauma simulation courses.",

      "value": "empirical",
      "justification": "The study presents practical findings from the use of a nominal group technique to evaluate a debriefing tool, indicating an empirical study.",
      "quote": "Seven participants participated in the nominal group. Based on the online survey results, the self-assessment debriefing strategy (from PEARLS) was rated 4.83/5 in relevance, the focused facilitation 5/5, and the provision of information 4.5/5."
