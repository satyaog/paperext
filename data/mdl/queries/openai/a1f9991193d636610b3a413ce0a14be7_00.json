    "description": "This paper presents an extension to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) for organizing and sharing microscopy data. The proposed Microscopy-BIDS intends to support a standardized structure for 2D/3D imaging methods and ensure metadata comprehensibility for hardware, image acquisition, and sample properties, enhancing data harmonization across imaging modalities.",

      "value": "theoretical",
      "justification": "The paper focuses on extending an existing data structure standard for microscopy data and discusses conceptual and standardization aspects rather than empirical data or experimentation.",
      "quote": "As the information required differs depending on the modalities and applications, an ideal standard should find a balance between usability/simplicity and completeness/complexity to promote adoption while remaining flexible enough to evolve with technological advancements and future community needs."
