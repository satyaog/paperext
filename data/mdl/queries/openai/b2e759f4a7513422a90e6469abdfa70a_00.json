    "description": "This paper explores the capability of trait-based models to predict ecological interactions and food web properties across various regions. By training models on vertebrate food webs from different ecosystems, the study evaluates how accurately these models can predict pairwise predator-prey interactions and network properties in novel environments. The findings suggest that while trait-based models can successfully predict interactions even in contrasting environments, they struggle with accurately forecasting food web-level properties.",
