    "description": "The paper discusses the implementation and evaluation of a TG-43 parameter and dose calculation module within the RapidBrachyMCTPS system, which is a brachytherapy treatment planning system. The research aims to optimize the Dww calculation using the TG-43 formalism for clinical dosimetry and involves the development of a specialized Monte Carlo usercode for accurate calculations.",
