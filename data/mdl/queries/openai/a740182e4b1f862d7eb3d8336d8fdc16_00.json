    "description": "The paper explores the theory of combining quantitative algebraic effects using sum and tensor operations. It extends classical algebraic operations to quantitative frameworks, introducing concepts like quantitative equational theories. The work provides categorical correspondences for these combinations when applied to effects modeled by monads, offering an algebraic perspective on several coalgebraic structures including Markov processes and Mealy machines with bisimilarity metrics. The paper builds upon prior work in algebraic effects and computational semantics.",

The paper's work on algebraic frameworks and mathematical proofs without empirical experiments highlights this theoretical nature.",
      "quote": "As our main result, we show that the sum and tensor of two quantitative equational theories correspond to the categorical sum (i.e., coproduct) and tensor, respectively, of their effects qua monads."
