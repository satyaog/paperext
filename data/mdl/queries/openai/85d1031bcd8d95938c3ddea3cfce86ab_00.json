    "description": "This paper presents a framework for transfer learning, discussing its applicability across different domains such as supervised, reinforcement, and imitation learning. It challenges existing beliefs about transfer learning and proposes a novel formalism to analyze transfer feasibility. The authors use structural causal models to model the learning process and derive conditions under which efficient transfer learning is possible.",

          "quote": "We now show when freezing an entire layer of the network leads to poor transfer, while freezing a subset of the layer leads to successful transfer. This example also demonstrates our approach where we treat transfer learning as a new problem separated from finding an invariant predictor which are often pursued in previous works (Zhang et al., 2020; Peters et al., 2015; Arjovsky et al., 2019). It also demonstrates a case of representation learning, where the distribution of the image X given its parents is assumed to be the same in all environments."
