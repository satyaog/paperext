    "description": "This paper evaluates the quality of metabolic chart data and its suitability for measuring core outcomes in children with medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency. It uses cohort data from a Canadian study to analyze the frequency of clinic visits and data quality concerning outcomes such as emergency department use, fasting time, metabolic decompensation, and death. The findings highlight a need for standardized documentation and improved data capture methods.",
