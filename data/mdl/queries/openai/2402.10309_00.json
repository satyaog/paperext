    "description": "The paper explores sampling from a discrete and structured distribution as a sequential decision problem. It proposes using Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to sample objects proportionally to a predefined reward. The paper extends methods to correct the reward in MaxEnt RL to ensure unbiased sampling in scenarios where multiple paths lead to the same outcome. It also establishes equivalences between certain GFlowNet and MaxEnt RL objectives, and evaluates the performance of various algorithms on problems that involve sampling from discrete distributions.",
