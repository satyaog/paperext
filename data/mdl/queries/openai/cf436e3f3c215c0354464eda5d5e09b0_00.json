    "description": "The paper examines the mortality trends and hospital length of stay for COVID-19 patients in Ontario and Québec, during the first three epidemic waves using population-based hospitalization data. It explores the changes in in-hospital mortality and ICU stay duration, accounting for patient and hospital level factors, in order to understand how these variables evolved through the pandemic's waves.",
