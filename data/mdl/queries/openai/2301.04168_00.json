In its original version, this method proposed to solve inverse problems using a Recurrent Neural Network as a metalearner to learn the iterative process of the optimization of a likelihood. RIMs\nhave been trained on a range of linear inverse problems both within and outside of astrophysics (LÃ¸nning et al.\n2019)."
