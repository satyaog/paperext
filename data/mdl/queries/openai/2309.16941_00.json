    "description": "The paper presents G4SATBench, a benchmark study that establishes a comprehensive evaluation framework for Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based SAT solvers. It curates a large and diverse set of SAT datasets, benchmarks various GNN models, and conducts empirical studies to provide insights into the performance and learning abilities of GNN-based SAT solvers compared to traditional ones.",
