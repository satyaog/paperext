    "description": "This study investigates the neural mechanisms underlying local parallelism as a perceptual grouping cue during naturalistic vision. It utilizes fMRI data, including publicly available datasets like BOLD5000, to explore how parallelism affects scene categorization and neural activation in different brain regions such as V1, V4, PPA, and RSC.",
