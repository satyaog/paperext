      "value": "empirical",
      "justification": "The paper is based on an experimental study with participants to measure vigilance decline using various tools, which implies an empirical research type.",
      "quote": "We used the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS), Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT), along with neurophysiological specialized equipment."
