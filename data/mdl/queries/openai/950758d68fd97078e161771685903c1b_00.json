    "description": "This paper investigates the emergence and role of time cells and ramping cells in recurrent neural networks of deep reinforcement learning models performing interval timing and working memory tasks. Using in-silico models, it demonstrates that these types of cells naturally arise and contribute to the network's performance primarily through their effect on recurrent dynamics rather than direct temporal information encoding.",
