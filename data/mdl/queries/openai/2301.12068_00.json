    "description": "This paper introduces DiffPreT, a novel pre-training approach that utilizes sequence-structure joint diffusion modeling to pre-train a protein encoder. It also enhances DiffPreT with Siamese Diffusion Trajectory Prediction (SiamDiff), which captures the correlation between different conformers of a protein through mutual information maximization.",
