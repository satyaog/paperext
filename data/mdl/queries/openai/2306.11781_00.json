    "description": "This paper explores how strong gravitational lensing can offer critical insights into the physical nature of dark matter. It offers a historical perspective, current status, challenges, and future prospects for using galaxy-scale strong gravitational lensing observations to test different dark matter models. The paper also reviews important methodological advances and discusses how these can help constrain the subgalactic dark matter structure.",
