    "description": "The paper investigates how Leishmania parasites transfer drug-resistance genes between themselves using extracellular vesicles (EVs). It highlights the role of EVs in horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and the enrichment of drug-resistance genes within these vesicles. The study demonstrates that this mechanism contributes to the increased fitness and survival of parasites in hostile environments.",
