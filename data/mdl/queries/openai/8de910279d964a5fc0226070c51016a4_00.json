    "description": "This paper aims to assess how children's surgical care is included in National Surgical, Obstetric and Anaesthesia Plans (NSOAPs) in low/middle-income countries. The study develops a framework based on the Global Initiative for Children's Surgery’s Optimal Resources for Children’s Surgery (OReCS) document and applies this framework to analyze the NSOAPs of Ethiopia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, and Zambia. The paper identifies the extent to which children's surgical care is addressed and provides recommendations for future policies.",
