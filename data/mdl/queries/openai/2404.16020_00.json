    "description": "This paper investigates the universality of adversarial triggers across different language models. It highlights the inconsistency in the transferability of these triggers between models aligned by preference optimization (APO) and those aligned by fine-tuning (AFT). The study also reveals that AFT models, although seemingly safe, are more susceptible to adversarial triggers compared to APO models.",
