    "description": "This paper presents a comprehensive framework named Metrics Reloaded, which aids researchers in selecting appropriate validation metrics for image analysis tasks, particularly in the biomedical domain. The framework is designed to address flaws in metric selection that hinder the translation of machine learning techniques into practice. It introduces a novel concept 'problem fingerprint' to guide metric selection and implements an online tool to support metric application. The development involved a large consortium and a Delphi process to ensure consensus and applicability across diverse biomedical use cases.",
