    "description": "The paper argues that the debate over the brain-computer metaphor is a matter of semantics due to differing definitions of 'computer' used within and outside of computer science. It suggests resolving this by clarifying the context in which the definition is used, encouraging researchers to engage with computer science's expansive definition where the brain is considered a literal computer, while acknowledging the limitations of traditional computer metaphors.",
