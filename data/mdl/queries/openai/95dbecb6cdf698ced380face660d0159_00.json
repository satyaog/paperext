    "description": "This research paper discusses a novel heterogeneous ensemble prediction model that integrates virtual mechanism data and real historical data. The model aims to predict carbon monoxide (CO) emission concentrations in municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) processes, combining both machine learning and deep learning techniques. It utilizes a linear regression decision tree (LRDT) algorithm for mechanism mapping and a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network for real data analysis. The models are combined through an inequality-constrained random weighted neural network (CIRWNN) for better prediction accuracy.",
