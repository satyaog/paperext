    "description": "The paper proposes Neural Stein Estimation (NSE), a new method for estimating expectations without sampling from intractable distributions. It is positioned as an alternative to Monte Carlo and Control Variate methods, leveraging the Stein operator and control variates to create a deterministic method. This is achieved by solving differential equations using neural networks, allowing for stable and accurate estimation, even in high-dimensional spaces.",
