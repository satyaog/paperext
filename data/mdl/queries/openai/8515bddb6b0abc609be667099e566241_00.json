    "description": "This paper proposes a framework for improving click-through rate (CTR) prediction in the recommendation domain by leveraging user search query representations. The approach involves using user search query sequences from the search domain to predict item clicks in the recommendation domain. It incorporates contrastive learning and diffusion models to enhance data sparsity issues and improves overall prediction performance.",
