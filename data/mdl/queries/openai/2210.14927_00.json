    "description": "This paper examines the qualitative and quantitative errors introduced into the visibilities and power spectrum due to inpainting in the analysis of data from instruments that measure the 21cm power spectrum. It assesses the effectiveness of various inpainting techniques on both simulated and real data (HERA), and introduces a convolutional neural network model called U-Paint as an inpainting technique. The study evaluates how different inpainting techniques affect the data analysis and the accuracy of the 21cm power spectrum estimation.",

As discussed in Section 2.3 the HERA visibilities are measures of 1024 frequency channels over 4000 time integrations (i.e ×NLSTs ). Thus we divide the total HERA visibilities into input visibilities of size 512×512 corresponding to 90min of data and a band width of 50MHz. Thus the frequency band is split into two sections 100MHz-150MHz and 150MHz-200MHz at 90min observation intervals."
