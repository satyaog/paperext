    "description": "The paper addresses the challenge of quantifying behavioral differences in continuous-time diffusion processes. It introduces two pseudometrics as solutions and characterizes them through real-valued modal logics, which serve as quantitative analogs to the logical characterization of bisimulation.",
    "type": {
      "value": "theoretical",
      "justification": "The paper is focused on defining theoretical concepts such as pseudometrics for continuous-time processes and proving their properties mathematically.",
      "quote": "In this work, we aim at quantifying how differently processes behave. We present two pseudometrics for diffusion-like processes. These pseudometrics are fixpoints of two different functionals on the space of 1-bounded pseudometrics on the state space."
