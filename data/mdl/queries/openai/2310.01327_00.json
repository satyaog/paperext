    "description": "This paper introduces TACTIS-2, a model for multivariate probabilistic time series prediction. It builds upon copula theory and proposes a simplified objective for transformer-based attentional copulas, making the model more efficient by ensuring the distributional parameters scale linearly with the number of variables. It introduces a two-stage training curriculum and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on various real-world forecasting tasks.",
