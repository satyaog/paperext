    "description": "This study investigates using a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network to predict the risk of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) during labor using cardiotocography records. The results indicate an increase in HIE sensitivity as delivery approaches, though the performance requires improvement. Future work intends to explore additional network architectures and signal transformations.",
