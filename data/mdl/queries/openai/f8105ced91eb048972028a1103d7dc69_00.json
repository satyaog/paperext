    "description": "This paper introduces EiG-Search, a method aimed at enhancing the explainability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by generating subgraph-level explanations through edge-induced subgraphs. The method is training-free, utilizes a linear-time search algorithm to find key subgraph structures, and demonstrates efficiency and superior performance across multiple datasets compared to existing methods.",
