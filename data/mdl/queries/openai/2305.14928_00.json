    "description": "This paper investigates how to improve misinformation mitigation using recent advancements in large language models like GPT-4 by focusing on generalization and uncertainty. It first demonstrates GPT-4's superior performance compared to earlier methods in multiple contexts and languages, then explores differences in failure modes between GPT-4 and RoBERTa-large. The paper also proposes new techniques to handle uncertainty and improve results and discusses additional tests and findings related to linguistic models, temperature, prompting, versioning, explainability, and web retrieval. Additionally, a new dataset, LIAR-New, which includes labeled misinformation data in English and French with Possibility labels, is introduced.",
