    "description": "This paper discusses the development of a patient registry for mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS), highlighting key values and objectives for enhancing research, understanding the disease, and facilitating treatments. It focuses on the governance structure, data collection, and participant involvement, aiming to improve care and outcomes for MPS patients.",

      "value": "theoretical",
      "justification": "The paper discusses the development of a registry and the framework around it rather than empirical results or experiments.",
      "quote": "Due to the rarity of mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS), there is a paucity of evidence from which to base treatment decisions."
