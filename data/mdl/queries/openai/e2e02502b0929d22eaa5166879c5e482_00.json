    "description": "The paper discusses the structure of excitation and inhibition in the MICrONS 1mm3 dataset, an electron microscopic reconstruction of cortical tissue, identifying non-random motifs of seven or more neurons that facilitate a feed-forward flow of information. It delves into the specific and symmetrical nature of inhibition which contrasts the notion of non-specific blanket inhibition, emphasizing the discovery of higher order connectivity patterns and their implications for learning and plasticity in the neocortex.",
