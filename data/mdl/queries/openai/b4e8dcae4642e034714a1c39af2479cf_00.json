    "description": "This study explores strategies for designing a resilient conservation network in Europe by 2030, focusing on the European Alps. Using semi-mechanistic simulations, the paper evaluates the effectiveness of current protected areas and predicts future biodiversity shifts due to climate change and land-use alterations. The research emphasizes the importance of transnational efforts to maintain biodiversity across the Alps.",
