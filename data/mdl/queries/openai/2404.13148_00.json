    "description": "The paper proposes a method called BACS to tackle catastrophic forgetting, background shift, and the initialization of new class heads in Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS). The authors introduce several main contributions, including a backward background shift detector, a modified cross-entropy loss, a masked feature-based knowledge distillation, and a transformer decoder. These innovations demonstrate significant improvements in handling a large number of tasks, particularly when starting from a small set of classes. The paper shows that BACS outperforms existing methods across standard benchmarks.",
