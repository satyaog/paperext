    "description": "This paper analyzes the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Canada over three periods: prevaccination, vaccine roll-out, and the arrival of the Omicron variant. By using a time-series approach and leveraging data from over 900,000 samples, it provides insights into the patterns of population immunity over time across different demographics and regions.",
