    "description": "This paper discusses the evaluation of denoising diffusion models in the context of offline model-based optimization (MBO). It introduces an evaluation framework to find validation metrics that correlate well with the ground truth oracle in MBO. The study also focuses on using denoising diffusion models due to their state-of-the-art performance and derives insights from the empirical evaluation of these models across several datasets and metrics.",
