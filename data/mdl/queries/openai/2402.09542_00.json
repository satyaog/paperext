    "description": "This paper introduces Layerwise Proximal Replay (LPR), a method designed to enhance the efficiency of online continual learning by combining experience replay with a proximal point method. This approach aims to stabilize optimization and improve accuracy by maintaining a balance between learning from new and past data without causing abrupt changes to the model's internal representations. The authors explore the performance of LPR across different setups in continual learning domains, evidencing improvements in both memory-constrained and unconstrained settings.",
