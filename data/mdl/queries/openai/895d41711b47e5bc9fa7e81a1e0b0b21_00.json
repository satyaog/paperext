    "description": "The paper discusses the challenges posed by AI-generated content and the importance of developing reliable detection mechanisms. It highlights new regulatory obligations for media and tech companies, especially in light of recent legal directives like the EU AI Act and the US Executive Order on AI. The paper proposes new duties for identifying AI-generated content to ensure social resilience and considers questions of policy concerning the deployment and regulation of these detection tools.",
