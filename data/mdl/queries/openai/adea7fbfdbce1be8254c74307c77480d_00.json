    "description": "The paper introduces T-NET, a weakly supervised graph learning model designed to address human trafficking detection by leveraging graph-based methods. The approach focuses on classifying clusters of ads instead of individual ads to detect suspicious activities related to human trafficking. T-NET employs graph contrastive learning and node classification and uses weak labels generated from domain-specific signals.",
