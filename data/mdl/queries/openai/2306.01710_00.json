    "description": "This paper introduces a novel, data-driven measure of uncertainty to improve misclassification detection in machine learning models. The proposed measure evaluates the uncertainty relative to different instances within the data, allowing it to detect misclassifications more effectively than traditional methods like Shannon entropy. The approach is empirically validated on multiple image classification tasks, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",
