    "description": "This paper explores the complexity of the Multi-Commodity Network Pricing Problem (NPP), a bilevel optimization problem involving network pricing and shortest path determination. It investigates the problem's complexity depending on the number of tolled arcs and commodities and introduces an algorithm to solve the NPP in polynomial time under certain conditions. The study also introduces the concepts of strong bilevel feasibility and uses convex conjugate to formulate the NPP's complexity, offering practical algorithms and demonstrating their efficacy through numerical experiments.",
