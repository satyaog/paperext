    "description": "This paper introduces a method for using amortized Bayesian inference to sample from intractable posterior distributions in autoregressive large language models (LLMs). By leveraging diversity-seeking reinforcement learning algorithms like generative flow networks (GFlowNets), the method aims to improve tasks such as sequence continuation, infilling, and other forms of constrained generation. Empirical results demonstrate its effectiveness over traditional maximum-likelihood training and policy optimization approaches.",
