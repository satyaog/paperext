    "description": "This paper introduces the Variational Independent Modules (VIM), a variational inference model for video prediction that learns latent representations as discrete objects and discovers modular causal mechanisms. The primary focus is on video prediction tasks, demonstrating that VIM can model visual sequences in an interpretable way and generalize to out-of-distribution observations.",
