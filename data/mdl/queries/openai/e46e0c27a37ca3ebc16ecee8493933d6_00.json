    "description": "The paper presents an adaptive admission control policy for mobile edge computing (MEC) to prevent edge node overloads using a reinforcement learning algorithm called SALMUT. The approach takes advantage of the structure in the optimal admission control policy, validating the solution through simulations and a docker testbed. The paper shows SALMUT's performance against state-of-the-art deep RL algorithms such as PPO and A2C, highlighting its efficiency in terms of training time and interpretability.",
