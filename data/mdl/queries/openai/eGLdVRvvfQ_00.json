    "description": "This paper proposes a framework for Direct Epistemic Uncertainty Prediction (DEUP), which aims to estimate the epistemic uncertainty originating from both approximation and model uncertainty. The method involves training a secondary predictor to estimate the generalization error subtracted by aleatoric uncertainty. DEUP is applicable in scenarios like sequential model optimization and reinforcement learning to guide exploration by predicting knowledge gaps.",
