    "description": "This paper provides a mathematical framework that outlines the conditions for the emergence of neural reactivation in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) optimized for tracking environmental state variables using noisy sensory information. The study demonstrates that these RNNs can revisit state configurations observed during online behavior in the absence of input, validated by numerical experiments on spatial position estimation and head direction estimation tasks.",
