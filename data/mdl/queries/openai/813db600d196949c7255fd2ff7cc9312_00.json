    "description": "This study explores the use of dose surface maps (DSMs) as a method to evaluate and compare the spatial accuracy of planned versus delivered doses to the rectum during prostate radiotherapy. Through analyzing results from 40 patients undergoing different radiation treatment plans (SBRT and IMRT), the study found that DSMs offer a more nuanced understanding of dose discrepancies and interfraction motion than traditional dose-volume histograms (DVHs), potentially improving dose delivery accuracy assessments.",
