    "description": "The paper introduces ART, a new corpus-level autoencoding approach to dense passage retrieval that doesn't require labeled training data. By using a passage-retrieval autoencoding scheme, ART allows effective unsupervised learning of passage and question encoders. The study demonstrates ART's superior performance on various QA retrieval benchmarks, showcasing its potential to replace traditional supervised retrievers without the need for custom hard-negative mining and dataset-specific losses.",
