    "description": "This paper addresses the challenges of retrieving and utilizing information from Building Information Models (BIM) through natural language-based search, emphasizing semantic tagging of user queries. It introduces a semantic annotation scheme rooted in the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) schema and conducts experiments comparing traditional and emergent deep learning architectures for NLP tasks within the BIM context.",
