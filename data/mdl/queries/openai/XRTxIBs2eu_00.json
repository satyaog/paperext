    "description": "This paper proposes a hybrid layer named Block-State Transformer (BST) that combines an SSM sublayer for long-range contextualization with a Block Transformer sublayer for short-term representation of sequences. The model outperforms similar Transformer-based architectures on language modeling perplexity and generalizes to longer sequences, achieving more than tenfold speedup at the layer level compared to other architectures when model parallelization is employed.",
