    "description": "This research paper explores the role of Target Networks in deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), emphasizing their regularization effect and associated instabilities. The authors propose a novel method called Functional Regularization (FR) as an alternative to Target Networks to enhance the stability and performance of value function learning. The paper provides theoretical analyses and empirical experiments to compare the effectiveness of FR against Target Networks across various environments.",
