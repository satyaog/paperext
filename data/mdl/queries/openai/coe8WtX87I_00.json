    "description": "The paper explores the capabilities of large language model-based agents in interacting with software via web browsers. It introduces WorkArena, a benchmark of tasks based on the ServiceNow platform, and BrowserGym, an environment for designing and evaluating web agents. The study reveals that while current agents show promise, there is a significant gap towards full task automation, especially between open and closed-source LLMs.",
