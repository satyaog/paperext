    "description": "This paper presents a novel learning paradigm named 'regeneration learning' for data generation tasks. The core concept involves segmenting data generation into two stages: first generating an intermediate representation of the target data, and then generating the target data from this intermediate representation. This method aims to simplify the overall data mapping process, making learning more efficient and effective when dealing with complex and high-dimensional data.",
