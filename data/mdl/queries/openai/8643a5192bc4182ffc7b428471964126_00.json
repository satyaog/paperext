    "description": "This paper explores the use of storyboards to collect language data for low-resource languages, aiming to mitigate the translationese effect by eliciting natural and fluent sentences from native speakers. The study compares this method with traditional translation-based approaches for languages like Hausa, Ibibio, Swahili, and Yorùbá.",
