    "description": "This paper introduces Forward-Looking Generative Flow Networks (FL-GFN). The novel approach leverages partial reward signals available at intermediate states using a reparameterization of the GFlowNet state flow function. This technique allows for improved credit assignment and the ability to learn from incomplete trajectories, promising faster convergence and better performance. The paper conducts extensive experiments in set generation, bit sequence generation, and molecule discovery to demonstrate the efficacy of FL-GFN.",
