    "description": "This paper explores how the distribution of synaptic weights in the brain is influenced by the choice of geometry used for synaptic plasticity. Using theoretical tools provided by mirror descent, the authors demonstrate that synaptic weight distributions will vary depending on whether Euclidean or non-Euclidean distances are used for synaptic changes. The paper shows that log-normal weight distributions observed experimentally in the brain are inconsistent with standard gradient descent (Euclidean geometry) but align with non-Euclidean geometries. The work provides a framework for experimentally determining the true geometry of synaptic plasticity by comparing synaptic weight distributions before and after learning.",
