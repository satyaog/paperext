    "description": "In this paper, the authors explore the theoretical boundaries and limitations when trying to achieve both accuracy and equal opportunity (EO) in machine learning classification tasks. They present geometric interpretations and mathematical proofs to show the incompatibility between EO and non-trivial accuracy in certain probabilistic data distributions. The results are verified through algorithmic implementations and examples based on both synthetic and real datasets.",
