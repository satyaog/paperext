    "description": "The paper discusses the use of Gaussian-process (GP)-based Bayesian optimization (BO) to optimize neurostimulation parameters in rats for maximizing electromyographic responses. A protocol is proposed for implanting rats with electrode arrays and using GP-BO for real-time optimization of stimulation parameters. The approach provides a flexible framework for solving high-dimensional optimization problems in clinical settings.",
