    "description": "This paper proposes a new version of neurophenomenology as 'generative passages', using generative modeling techniques from computational neuroscience and biology to formalize and study the descriptions of lived experiences in phenomenology. The approach aims to construct computational models that explain lived experience through inferential processes.",
