    "description": "This paper presents Spectral Temporal Contrastive Learning (STCL), an adaptation of Spectral Contrastive Learning (SCL) to the temporal contrastive learning setting. The authors derive the STCL loss based on a state graph generated from a time-homogeneous reversible Markov chain and demonstrate its connection to the spectral properties of the graph, providing theoretical insights and empirical results for downstream linear probing tasks.",
