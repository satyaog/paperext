    "description": "This paper discusses the complexities and limitations of evaluating the generalization capabilities of coreference resolution (CR) models using multiple datasets. It introduces the measurement modeling framework from the social sciences to highlight how differing definitions and operationalizations of coreference across datasets can confound evaluation results. Through a multi-dataset evaluation of CR models, the study shows that inconsistencies in annotations and definitions across datasets can limit the validity of conclusions drawn from such evaluations.",
