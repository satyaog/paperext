    "description": "This paper outlines a scoping review protocol to analyze the use of artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning and deep learning, for the identification and management of frailty. It details the systematic search that will be conducted across eight major academic databases and presents the methodology for selecting and charting the data. The review will focus on clinical tools and frameworks used to assess frailty, the outcomes evaluated, and the engagement of knowledge users in the development and implementation of AI methods for frailty care.",
