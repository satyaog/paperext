    "description": "The paper proposes a model for the assignment of EV charging demand to stations, framing it as a maximum flow problem. It integrates this model into a mixed-integer linear program to optimize the location and capacity expansion of EV charging stations. The methodology is showcased for the city of Montreal, demonstrating its ability to handle real-world scenarios.",
