    "description": "The paper presents a systematic review and meta-analysis of seroprevalence studies for SARS-CoV-2, aligned with the World Health Organization Unity protocol, to estimate the extent of global infection and immunity from January 2020 to May 2022.",

      "justification": "The research is based on empirical data collection from various studies that involve systematic reviews and are adjusted through meta-analysis, focusing on observed data rather than theoretical propositions.",
      "quote": "We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, searching MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, preprints, and grey literature for SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence published between 2020-01-01 and 2022-05-20."
