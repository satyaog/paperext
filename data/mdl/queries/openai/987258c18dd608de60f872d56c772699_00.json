    "description": "This research paper explores the use of foliar spectral reflectance to differentiate tree species and investigate its phylogenetic structure. The study involves over 3500 leaf-level spectral measurements for tree species classification in eastern North America. The authors aim to demonstrate the potential of spectroscopy for plant biodiversity monitoring and the link between spectral diversity, taxonomic hierarchy, and phylogenetic and functional diversity.",
