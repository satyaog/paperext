    "description": "This paper addresses the optimization of functions with expensive gradient computations by proposing a framework that uses these expensive gradient computations to construct surrogate functions in a target space. These surrogates can be minimized efficiently, allowing for multiple parameter updates and amortizing the computational cost. The paper introduces both deterministic and stochastic target smoothness surrogates with theoretical guarantees and evaluates their framework on supervised and imitation learning tasks.",
