    "description": "This research paper explores the combination of metaheuristics and learned neural network solvers for combinatorial optimization in the context of the transit network design problem. The authors train a neural network policy to perform single-shot planning of individual transit routes and integrate it into a modified Bee Colony Optimization (BCO) metaheuristic algorithm. The hybrid algorithm outperforms both the learned policy alone and the original BCO algorithm on realistic problem instances.",
