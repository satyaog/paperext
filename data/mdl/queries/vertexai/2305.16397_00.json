    "description": "The paper investigates the capability of diffusion models for vision-and-language reasoning, particularly focusing on Stable Diffusion. It introduces DiffusionITM, a novel method to adapt diffusion models for image-text matching tasks by measuring the difference in noise prediction error with and without text conditioning. The authors evaluate DiffusionITM on GDBench, a new benchmark comprising eight diverse image-text matching tasks, and find that Stable Diffusion with DiffusionITM exhibits competitive performance against CLIP, especially on compositional reasoning tasks. Additionally, they discover that fine-tuning Stable Diffusion on MS-COCO with hard negatives further enhances its performance on GDBench, suggesting potential for improved discriminative abilities in generative models.",
