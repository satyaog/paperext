    "description": "This paper presents a concise review of biases in Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS) by surveying recent literature. The authors examine the presence of biases throughout the system’s pipeline and consider the challenges that arise from combining multiple models. The study investigates biases in classic recommender systems and their relevance to CRS. Moreover, the paper addresses specific biases in CRS, considering variations with and without natural language understanding capabilities, along with biases related to dialogue systems and language models.",
