    "description": "The paper focuses on Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) in Machine Learning software. The authors analyze 318 open-source ML projects across five domains and compare them to 318 non-ML projects. They investigate the prevalence, composition, location, and evolution of SATD, finding that ML projects have a higher percentage of SATD compared to non-ML projects. The study reveals that ML pipeline components for data preprocessing and model generation are more prone to debt, and SATDs appear earlier in ML projects. The research also explores the characteristics of long-lasting SATDs, providing insights for ML practitioners and researchers.",
