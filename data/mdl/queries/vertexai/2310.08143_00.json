To achieve such performance microbubble contrast agents must perfuse the entire microvascular network.\\nMicrobubbles are then located individually and tracked over time to sample individual vessels, typically over hundreds of thousands of images. To overcome the fundamental limit of diffraction and achieve a dense reconstruction of the network, low microbubble concentrations must be used, which lead to acquisitions lasting several minutes. Conventional processing pipelines are currently unable to deal with interference from multiple nearby microbubbles, further reducing achievable concentrations. This work overcomes this problem by proposing a Deep Learning approach to recover dense vascular networks from ultrasound acquisitions with high microbubble concentrations. A realistic mouse brain microvascular network, segmented from 2-photon microscopy, was used to train a three-dimensional convolutional neural network based on a V-net architecture.\\nUltrasound data sets from multiple microbubbles flowing through the microvascular network were simulated and used as ground truth to train the 3D CNN to track microbubbles. The 3D-CNN approach was validated in silico using a subset of the data and in vivo on a rat brain acquisition. In silico, the CNN reconstructed vascular networks with higher precision (81%) than a conventional ULM framework (70%). In vivo, the CNN could resolve micro vessels as small as 10 ùùÅùíé with an increase in resolution when compared against a conventional approach.\\nIndex Terms‚ÄîDeep Learning, Ultrasound Localization Microscopy.\\n\\nI. INTRODUCTION\\n\\nU\\n\\nltrasound Localization Microscopy (ULM) bypasses the intrinsic spatial resolution of conventional contrastenhanced ultrasound imaging via the localization of\\n\\nsparse microbubbles (MB) populations across ultrasound images [1], [2], [3]. As of today, ULM appears to be the only cost-effective, non-invasive, and non-ionizing method for the imaging of the microvasculature in large fields of view in vivo and in several organs such as the brain [4]. Adding tracking algorithms to the detection of MB enabled to map blood flow velocity maps [5]. The study of the microvascular angioarchitecture and its function at-depth and in vivo could become a powerful tool in the development of novel biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases, cardiac diseases and cancer [6].\\nNevertheless, the clinical application of ULM is limited essentially by its required long, motion-free acquisition time (a few minutes) to output a single highly resolved image.\\nThis issue can be addressed in part by increasing MB density [7]. However, higher densities increase the difficulty of precisely localizing MB. Indeed, as they flow throughout the vascular network, MB that are close to one-another lead to US signal interference, preventing their accurate localization with a peak detection algorithm. Several processing techniques have been proposed to tackle this multi-object localization in ultrasound images. In [8] and [9], efficient filtering methods have been introduced based respectively on background removal, spatio-temporal-interframe-correlation based data acquisition, and separating spatially overlapping MB events into sub-populations. Some also use advance pairing techniques that discard unrealistic MB trajectories [10] or graph-based MB tracking on denoised images [11]. In [12], authors exposed the encouraging capacity of neural networks to spatio-temporally filter single MB in in vivo ULM images by training CNN to perform conventional signal processing methods. Others investigated the application of deep learning-based algorithms to enhance the localization of individual MB when higher concentrations are used. Those were either based on radiofrequency (RF) data [13] or envelope-detected images\\n[14], [15], [16], [17] and all relied on a per-frame localization.\\n\\nManuscript sent July 01, 2020.
