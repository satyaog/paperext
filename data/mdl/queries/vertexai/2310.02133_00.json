    "description": "This paper proposes a new framework that bridges logical reasoning and deep learning by generating interpretable and verifiable logical rules through differentiable learning. The approach builds upon SATNet, a differentiable MaxSAT solver, to learn the underlying rules from input-output examples. To enhance interpretability, the authors introduce \"maximum equality\", a method that transforms learned weights into a weighted MaxSAT formula, enabling the extraction of human-readable rules. The framework is evaluated on stream transformations and Sudoku problems, demonstrating its ability to generate reliable and verifiable rules.",
