    "description": "The paper introduces a novel three-stage approach based on transformers coupled with conditional diffusion models to enhance the robustness of medical image classification models. The approach involves learning hierarchical feature representations using multiple image encoders, generating prediction candidates through a reverse diffusion process guided by latent code, and aggregating the candidates using a bilevel aggregation protocol. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on the Tuberculosis chest X-ray classification benchmark and the ISIC skin cancer classification benchmark, showing improvements in robustness and confidence calibration over state-of-the-art methods.",
