    "description": "This paper proposes a framework to guarantee the energy sufficiency of a battery-powered robot during missions in unknown environments. The framework leverages Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to ensure that the robot does not run out of energy, regardless of the environment or mission. The authors validate their approach through simulations and experiments on a physical AgileX Scout Mini rover.",
