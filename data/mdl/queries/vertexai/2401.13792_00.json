    "description": "The paper focuses on developing a probabilistic approach for mobility load balancing (MLB) in multi-band 5G and beyond networks. The authors argue that traditional load balancing methods, which primarily rely on channel quality indicators like RSRQ, can be suboptimal as they don\\'t fully consider UE demands and band resources. They propose an event-based algorithm that models load balancing as a multi-objective stochastic optimization problem. This aims to evenly distribute traffic across bands while minimizing inter-frequency handovers to reduce signaling overhead and interruption time. The proposed algorithm utilizes a probabilistic assignment scheme, assigning UEs to bands based on probability distributions derived from a linear program that considers factors such as UE data rates, traffic demands, and band resources. The authors validate their approach through simulations, demonstrating improved network performance in terms of throughput and interruption time compared to traditional MLB methods.",
