    "description": "This work proposes NACL (Neighbor Aware CaLibration), a solution for calibrating deep segmentation networks, particularly addressing the limitations of the Spatially Varying Label Smoothing (SVLS) approach by introducing equality constraints on logit values. The paper provides a constrained optimization perspective of SVLS and demonstrates its implicit constraint on soft class proportions of surrounding pixels. NACL aims to offer more flexibility and control over the calibration process, potentially leading to improved uncertainty estimates in medical image segmentation tasks.",
