  justification: It is the title of the research paper.
  quote: A Diffusion-Model of Joint Interactive Navigation
description: This paper presents DJINN, a diffusion model for generating joint traffic scenarios with flexible conditioning
  based on agent states. Evaluation on popular trajectory forecasting datasets shows state-of-the-art performance for joint
  trajectory metrics and demonstrates the model's ability to perform goal-based sampling, behavior-class sampling, and scenario
  editing.
