  quote: An Intentional Forgetting-Driven Self-Healing Method For Deep Reinforcement Learning Systems
description: This paper proposes a novel self-healing approach for Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) systems called Dr. DRL,
  which integrates intentional forgetting mechanisms into Continual Learning (CL) to address issues like catastrophic forgetting
  and slow convergence in DRL systems. This approach selectively forgets minor behaviors in order to prioritize the DRL system's
  key problem-solving skills, thereby accelerating adaptation to environmental drifts and improving overall performance.
type:
  value: empirical
  justification: The paper includes experimental evaluations of the proposed approach using different DRL algorithms and environments.
  quote: In this paper, we propose Dr. DRL, a self-healing approach for DRL systems that integrates a novel mechanism of intentional
    forgetting into vanilla CL (i.e., standard CL) to overcome its main issues... To demonstrate the effectiveness of Dr.
    DRL, we evaluate it on purposefully drifted gym environments with different drifting intensities.
