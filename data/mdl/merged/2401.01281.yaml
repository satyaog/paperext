  quote: Influence of scanning plane on Human Spinal Cord functional Magnetic Resonance echo planar imaging
description: This study investigates the effect of sagittal versus axial scanning on the quality of spinal cord functional
  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (scfMRI) data. Utilizing a Philips Achieva 3T MRI scanner, the research compares metrics such
  as tSNR, Dice Coefficient, Reproducibility, and Sensitivity between the two scanning planes. The findings suggest that axial
  scanning is generally more advantageous for mitigating physiological noise and ensuring higher data quality.
type:
  value: empirical
  justification: The study involves systematic data collection and analysis to compare the effectiveness of axial versus sagittal
    scanning planes for spinal cord fMRI.
  quote: This study was aimed at systematically verify whether sagittal scanning in scfMRI using EPI readout is a viable alternative
    to the more common axial scanning, and at optimizing a pipeline for EPI-based scfMRI data analysis, based on Spinal Cord
    Toolbox (SCT).

    justification: The focus of the study is on imaging the spinal cord using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI).
    quote: However, the interpretation of spinal cord fMRI (scfMRI) is still controversial and its diffusion is rather limited
      because of technical limitations.
