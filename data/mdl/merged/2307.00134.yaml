  quote: Generalization Limits of Graph Neural Networks in Identity Effects Learning
description: This paper investigates the generalization properties and fundamental limits of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
  when it comes to learning identity effects. The analysis includes theoretical findings supported by numerical studies to
  understand the capabilities of GNNs, with specific focus on their performance on tasks like two-letter word classification
  and dicyclic graph classification.
