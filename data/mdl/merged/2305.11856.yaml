  quote: 'Video Killed the HD-Map: Predicting Multi-Agent Behavior Directly From Aerial Images'
description: This paper introduces an aerial image-based map (AIM) representation that requires minimal annotation and provides
  rich road context information for multi-agent behavior modeling in autonomous driving. It integrates AIM into a differentiable
  driving simulator and demonstrates competitive multi-agent trajectory prediction performance compared to high-definition
  maps.
type:
  value: empirical
  justification: The paper conducts experiments and provides evaluation metrics for multi-agent trajectory prediction using
    the AIM representation.
  quote: We evaluate multi-agent trajectory prediction using the AIM by incorporating it into a differentiable driving simulator
    as an image-texture-based differentiable rendering module.
