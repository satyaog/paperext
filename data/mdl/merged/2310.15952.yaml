  quote: Improving Robustness and Reliability in Medical Image Classification with Latent-Guided Diffusion and Nested-Ensembles
description: This paper introduces a three-stage approach integrating transformers and conditional diffusion models to improve
  model robustness in medical image classification. It includes learning hierarchical feature representations, a reverse diffusion
  process guided by latent code to propose prediction candidates, and a bilevel aggregation protocol for final output.
type:
  value: empirical
  justification: The paper describes experiments and evaluations conducted on benchmark datasets to validate the proposed
    method.
  quote: Through extensive experiments on medical imaging benchmark datasets, we show that our method improves upon state-of-the-art
    methods in terms of robustness and confidence calibration.
