description: "This study introduces ICE-SEARCH, a methodology that combines language models (LMs) with evolutionary algorithms\
  \ for feature selection in Medical Predictive Analytics (MPA). ICE-SEARCH employs LMs for crossover and mutation within\
  \ an evolutionary framework, enhancing FS by utilizing the model\u2019s comprehensive world knowledge."

    value: Feature Selection
    justification: The core contribution of the paper is in the domain of feature selection, using innovative techniques that
      combine language models with evolutionary algorithms.
    quote: In this context, the process of feature selection (FS) becomes critically important. By identifying the most pertinent
      subset of features within vast datasets, FS facilitates a more efficient analysis.
