  quote: Learning Reliable Logical Rules with SATNet
description: "This paper presents a novel framework that bridges logical reasoning and deep learning by generating interpretable\
  \ and verifiable logical rules through differentiable learning without the need for pre-specified logical structures. The\
  \ proposed methodology improves upon SATNet, a differentiable MaxSAT solver, by introducing a maximum equality specification\
  \ method that decodes SATNet\u2019s learned weights into human-readable logical rules. The framework also incorporates domain\
  \ knowledge for enhanced reliability."
