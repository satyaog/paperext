    object detection models
  justification: The title clearly describes the main finding and contribution of the paper.
  quote: Realistically distributing object placements in synthetic training data improves the performance of vision-based
    object detection models
description: This paper investigates the impact of object placement distribution in synthetic training data on the performance
  of vision-based object detection models in driving contexts. The authors propose that realistic object placement can significantly
  improve model performance and demonstrate this through experiments using CARLA and KITTI datasets.
type:
  value: empirical
  justification: The paper includes experiments and empirical results that demonstrate the impact of object placement distribution
    on model performance.
  quote: In this paper we test the hypothesis that the realism of physical object placement distribution in synthetic data
    has a significant impact on the performance of vision models trained on said data. We use a carefully controlled experimental
    setup...
