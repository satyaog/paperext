  quote: 'Implicit Diffusion: Efficient Optimization through Stochastic Sampling'
description: The paper presents a new algorithm called Implicit Diffusion, which focuses on optimizing distributions defined
  implicitly by parameterized stochastic diffusions. This algorithm performs optimization and sampling steps jointly in a
  single loop, inspired by bilevel optimization and automatic implicit differentiation techniques. The authors provide theoretical
  guarantees and demonstrate the effectiveness of the method through various experiments.
