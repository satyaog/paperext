  quote: Learning to Scale Logits for Temperature-Conditional GFlowNets
description: The paper introduces Logit-scaling GFlowNets (Logit-GFN), a new architectural design aimed at improving the training
  efficiency and stability of temperature-conditional GFlowNets. The method reduces the numerical challenges arising from
  different gradient profiles at various temperatures by using a learned function of temperature to scale the logits of the
  policy directly. Empirical results show enhanced generalization and mode discovery in various biological and chemical tasks
  using this approach.
