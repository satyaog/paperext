description: This research focuses on optimizing bid prices for real-time bidding (RTB) in online display advertisements.
  The goal is to design a risk-aware data-driven bid optimization model that maximizes the expected profit for the advertiser
  while controlling the risk of overspending the budget within a given period.

    value: Deep Censored Learning
    justification: The Deep Censored Learning model is mentioned in the context of boosting CTR prediction quality and winning
      price distribution.
    quote: The recent DL advancement also applies to the bid landscape problem. [Wu et al., 2018b] proposed the Deep Censored
      Learning model that uses a DL model for CTR prediction to boost the prediction quality on the winning price and considers
      its distribution into the learning.
