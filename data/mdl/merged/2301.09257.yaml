  quote: Real-Time Simultaneous Localization and Mapping with LiDAR Intensity
description: This paper proposes a novel real-time LiDAR intensity image-based SLAM system aimed at solving the geometric
  degeneracy problem in unstructured environments. It directly extracts feature points from intensity images for scan registration
  to estimate the robot's ego-movement and includes systems for loop closure detection and pose graph optimization.
type:
  value: empirical
  justification: The paper includes experimental evaluations and performance comparisons with other methods, indicating empirical
    research.

    \ environment with long corridors, a multi-storey indoor environment, a mountain, and a street environment."

    justification: A-LOAM is specifically mentioned as a SLAM system with which the proposed method is compared experimentally.
    quote: We also test our algorithm indoors with a Spot robot (from Boston Dynamics) equipped with Ouster Os0-64 LiDAR (Fig.
      9a). The scene of this experiment mainly contains the same long corridor as Fig. 9b. In this scenario, we ran different
      algorithms for testing the ability of localization and map building in real world. Both Fig. 6a and Fig. 7a are the
      maps generated by our algorithm. Fig. 6b and Fig. 7b then show the trajectories of different algorithms in the corresponding
      environments.
