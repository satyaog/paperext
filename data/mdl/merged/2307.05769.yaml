  quote: Joint Machine-Transporter Scheduling for Multistage Jobs with Adjustable Computation Time
description: This paper presents an optimization method with adjustable computation time for scheduling problems involving
  machines and transporters across multiple stages. The proposed approach involves discretizing time, clustering jobs, and
  using integer linear programming to create schedules that minimize both time and energy consumption. The method is applied
  to a robotic water sampling project.
type:
  value: empirical
  justification: The paper involves experimentation and simulation on a real-world problem (robotic water sampling project),
    providing data and results.
  quote: This section shows simulation results on 15 randomly generated experiments with 100 jobs, 10 drones, and 10 laboratories.

    value: Combinatorial Optimization
    justification: The problem of scheduling and assigning machines and transporters for fixed operations is a classic example
      of a combinatorial optimization problem.
    quote: This problem is a variation of the flexible flow shop with transports, that is proven to be NP-complete.

    value: Nova Scotia water sampling dataset
    justification: The experiments simulate a real-world water sampling project along the coast of Nova Scotia.
    quote: As an experiment, the proposed method is implemented in an automated system for water sampling along the coast
      of Nova Scotia using a swarm of flying robots that could be considered one of the current large-scale water sampling
      programs in which shellfish production is regulated by the Canadian Shellfish Sanitation Program (CSSP) and requires
      determination of water sanitation levels on shellfish beds by monitoring the presence of E. Coli.
