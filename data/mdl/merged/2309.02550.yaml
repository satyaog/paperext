  quote: "Tidying Up the Conversational Recommender Systems\u2019 Biases"
description: "The paper offers a review of biases in Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS) by surveying recent literature\
  \ and examining biases across the system\u2019s pipeline. It explores biases in classic recommender systems and their relevance\
  \ to CRS, also addressing specific biases within CRS involving language models, dialogue systems, and natural language understanding.\
  \ The study emphasizes the importance of a holistic approach to manage biases in complex CRS models."
