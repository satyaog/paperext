  quote: Bug Characterization in Machine Learning-based Systems
description: The paper investigates the characteristics of bugs in ML-based software systems, comparing ML and non-ML bugs
  from the software maintenance viewpoint. The study involves a manual inspection of issues from GitHub repositories that
  use TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras, aiming to identify patterns and suggest areas for improvement in maintenance practices
  and tool support.
