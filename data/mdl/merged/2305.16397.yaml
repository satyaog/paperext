  value: Are Diffusion Models Vision-And-Language Reasoners?
  justification: The title is accurate because the study directly addresses the vision-and-language reasoning capabilities
    of diffusion models.
  quote: Are Diffusion Models Vision-And-Language Reasoners?
description: This research investigates whether diffusion models can perform vision-and-language reasoning, using Stable Diffusion
  models to introduce DiffusionITM method for image-text matching. The study also proposes GDBench, a benchmark for seven
  complex vision-and-language tasks and bias evaluation.
type:
  value: empirical
  justification: The study involves experiments and evaluations on proposed methods using datasets and benchmarks.
  quote: In this work, we evaluate language-conditioned generative image models on discriminative tasks to shed light on their
    fine-grained understanding of vision and language.
