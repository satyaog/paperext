description: The paper addresses the challenge of load balancing in multi-band 5G and beyond networks, proposing a probabilistic
  mobility load balancing (PMLB) algorithm. The algorithm models load balancing as a multi-objective stochastic optimization
  problem, aiming to distribute user equipment (UE) traffic evenly across bands while minimizing handovers. The approach leverages
  linear programming and event-based operations to enhance network performance, as demonstrated through simulation results.

    quote: MLB in 3GPP standards is defined as moving cell-edge user equipment units (UEs) in a crowded cell to a less-crowded
      neighboring cell. In multi-band networks, MLB can additionally move UEs between the available bands via inter-frequency
      handovers (HOs) based on the channel quality for each band
