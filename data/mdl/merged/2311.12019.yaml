title:
  value: An Empirical Study of Self-Admitted Technical Debt in Machine Learning Software
  justification: The title aptly encapsulates the paper's primary focus on studying self-admitted technical debt in machine
    learning projects from an empirical perspective.
  quote: An Empirical Study of Self-Admitted Technical Debt in Machine Learning Software
description: The paper investigates the presence and characteristics of self-admitted technical debt (SATD) in machine learning
  (ML) software by analyzing 318 open-source ML projects across five domains. The study compares the occurrence of SATD in
  ML projects with non-ML projects, categorizes the types of SATD found, examines the stages of the ML pipeline prone to SATD,
  and explores the dynamics of SATD introduction and removal.
type:
  value: theoretical
  justification: It's confusing because they empirically evaluate the technical debt in ML code, but it is not an empirical
    study based on our definition.
