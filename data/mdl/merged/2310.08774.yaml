description: This paper adopts the framework of generative flow networks (GFlowNets) to address challenges in phylogenetics,
  specifically focusing on parsimony-based and Bayesian phylogenetic inference. The authors introduce a novel model, PhyloGFN,
  and demonstrate its competitive performance against existing state-of-the-art methods on several datasets. The paper makes
  significant contributions to the field by offering effective solutions for sampling multimodal posterior distributions over
  tree topologies and evolutionary distances.

      in marginal likelihood estimation due to simplifying assumptions. In parsimony analysis, state-of-the-art methods such
      as PAUP* (Swofford, 1998) have extensively relied on heuristic search algorithms that are efficient but lack theoretical
      foundations and guarantees.
