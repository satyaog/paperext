  quote: 'Transformers in Reinforcement Learning: A Survey'
description: This survey explores how transformers are employed in reinforcement learning to tackle challenges like unstable
  training, credit assignment, lack of interpretability, and partial observability. It covers applications of transformers
  in different RL contexts, including representation learning, modeling transition and reward functions, and policy optimization.
  It also reviews training strategies, interpretability techniques, and real-world applications of transformers in RL.

    value: Decision Transformer
    justification: The Decision Transformer is detailed as a model for sequence prediction in offline RL, leveraging past
      states, actions, and return-to-go.
    quote: The decision transformer (DT) [23] (Fig. 9) is an offline RL method that uses the upside-down RL paradigm (see
      Sec. 2.1). It uses a transformer-decoder to predict actions conditioned on past states, past actions, and expected return-to-go
      (the sum of the future rewards).
