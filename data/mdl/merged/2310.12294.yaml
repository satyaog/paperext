  quote: Open-Set Multivariate Time-Series Anomaly Detection
description: This paper introduces the Multivariate Open-Set time-series Anomaly Detector (MOSAD), which is the first algorithm
  to address the open-set time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) problem. MOSAD utilizes a multi-head network with Generative,
  Discriminative, and Anomaly-Aware Contrastive heads to detect anomalies in multivariate time-series datasets. Extensive
  experiments demonstrate MOSAD's superior performance over existing methods.
type:
  value: empirical
  justification: The paper presents extensive experiments on real-world datasets to validate the proposed MOSAD model.
  quote: Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets establish MOSAD as a new state-of-the-art in the TSAD field.

    justification: The main focus is on detecting anomalies in multivariate time-series data.
    quote: This paper is the first to address the open-set TSAD problem, in which a small number of labeled anomalies are
      introduced in the training phase in order to achieve superior anomaly detection performance compared to both supervised
      and unsupervised TSAD algorithms.
