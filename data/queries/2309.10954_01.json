    "description": "The paper studies in-context learning (ICL) using large language models (LLMs) for tasks with many labels, addressing the challenge posed by the limited context window of these models. It proposes a method to overcome this limitation by using a pre-trained dense retrieval model to provide the model with a partial view of the full label space for each inference call. The method is evaluated on multiple datasets, showing state-of-the-art performance in certain settings without finetuning.",
