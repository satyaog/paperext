    "description": "The paper explores two large acoustic pretrained models, ECAPA-TDNN and Wav2Vec 2.0/XLSR, for the task of accent classification in multiple languages. The authors provide a detailed recipe for using these models with the SpeechBrain toolkit and introduce a new benchmark dataset, CommonAccent, derived from the Common Voice dataset. The results indicate strong performance in accent classification, particularly with the Wav2Vec 2.0/XLSR model.",
