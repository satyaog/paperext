    "description": "This paper introduces the Multivariate Open-Set time-series Anomaly Detector (MOSAD), which is the first algorithm to address the open-set time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) problem. MOSAD utilizes a multi-head network with Generative, Discriminative, and Anomaly-Aware Contrastive heads to detect anomalies in multivariate time-series datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate MOSAD's superior performance over existing methods.",
