    "description": "This paper proposes a novel approach for pre-training Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) in a reward-free, unsupervised manner. The authors introduce an outcome-conditioned GFlowNet (OC-GFN) which learns to reach targeted outcomes in a self-supervised way, enabling efficient adaptation to downstream tasks. The paper demonstrates significant improvements in sample diversity and efficiency through extensive experiments in domains like GridWorld and biological sequence design tasks.",
