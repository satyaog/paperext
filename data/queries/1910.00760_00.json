    "description": "The paper proposes Graph Recurrent Attention Networks (GRANs), a deep generative model that efficiently and effectively generates large graph structures while maintaining state-of-the-art sample quality. The model uses an attention-based graph neural network for auto-regressive graph generation and introduces innovations such as marginalizing node orderings and parameterizing output distributions with a mixture of Bernoulli distributions.",
