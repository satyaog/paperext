    "description": "This paper introduces a novel method for the reward-free pre-training of Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) called the outcome-conditioned GFlowNet (OC-GFN). The authors demonstrate how these pre-trained models can be efficiently fine-tuned for diverse downstream tasks with new reward functions. Experimental results validate the efficacy and efficiency of this approach across various domains including GridWorld and biological sequence design tasks.",
