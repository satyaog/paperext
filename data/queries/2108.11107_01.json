    "description": "This paper investigates the prospects of developing a future accelerator-based neutrino oscillation experiment in China. It includes site selection, beam optimization, and discussions on tau neutrino physics, CP violation, non-unitary mixing, and non-standard neutrino interactions. Simulated neutrino beam setups based on muon and beta decay techniques are used for comparison across various Chinese laboratory sites.",
