    "description": "This paper explores the combination of metaheuristics and neural network solvers for combinatorial optimization, specifically focusing on the transit network design problem (NDP). It proposes a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) policy model that is incorporated into a modified Bee Colony Optimization (BCO) metaheuristic algorithm, termed Neural BCO (NBCO). The experimental results show that NBCO outperforms both the standalone GNN and the traditional BCO algorithm on realistic problem instances.",
