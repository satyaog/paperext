    "description": "This paper proposes Dr. DRL, a self-healing approach for deep reinforcement learning (DRL) systems that integrates intentional forgetting into continual learning (CL) to overcome issues like catastrophic forgetting, warm-starting failure, and slow convergence. The method prioritizes adapting key problem-solving skills while erasing minor behaviors, leading to reduced healing times and improved adaptability.",
