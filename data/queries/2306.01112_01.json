    "description": "The paper investigates day-ahead solar irradiance forecasting by leveraging spatio-temporal context from satellite data. It introduces CrossViViT, a novel deep learning architecture that combines satellite imagery and time series data to make highly accurate predictions of solar irradiance at various stations. The study also emphasizes the importance of considering cloud cover for reliable forecasting and proposes a unique testing scheme to evaluate model performance in challenging scenarios.",
