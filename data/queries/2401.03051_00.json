    "description": "This paper presents a convergence analysis of the SUCPA algorithm within the context of dynamical systems. The study focuses on the local and global stability of the nonlinear map derived from the SUCPA algorithm, used for calibrating scores output by machine learning classifiers. The primary goal is to demonstrate the global asymptotic stability of this map, especially for binary classification problems, with numerical experiments supporting the theoretical findings.",
