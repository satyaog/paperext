    "description": "The paper investigates the presence and characteristics of self-admitted technical debt (SATD) in machine learning (ML) software by analyzing 318 open-source ML projects across five domains. The study compares the occurrence of SATD in ML projects with non-ML projects, categorizes the types of SATD found, examines the stages of the ML pipeline prone to SATD, and explores the dynamics of SATD introduction and removal.",
