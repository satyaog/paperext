    "description": "This paper introduces the Gemini family of multimodal deep learning models developed by Google. The models—Gemini Ultra, Pro, and Nano—are designed to handle a variety of tasks across text, image, audio, and video modalities. The paper reports state-of-the-art performance by Gemini Ultra on numerous benchmarks and discusses the models' architecture, training processes, applications, and societal impact considerations.",
