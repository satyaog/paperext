    "description": "The paper introduces GPS++, a hybrid Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) and Graph Transformer model designed for molecular property prediction. GPS++ integrates a local message passing component with global attention mechanisms and various features to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the PCQM4Mv2 dataset. An extensive ablation study shows that even without global self-attention, the MPNN component alone remains highly competitive.",

This achieves 87% packing efficiency of the nodes and edges with on average 3.6 graphs per pack, though we believe that this could be increased by employing a more complex packing strategy (Krell et al., 2021)."
