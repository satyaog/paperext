The study identifies the limitations of both retrievers and language models, as well as their combined performance. It explores models such as kNN-LM, REALM, DPR + FiD, Contriever + ATLAS, and Contriever + Flan-T5, and their effectiveness in reasoning tasks using datasets like EntailmentBank and StrategyQA.",
