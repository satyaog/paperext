    "description": "This paper introduces Goal2FlowNets, a method that leverages Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to learn diverse, goal-conditioned policies for reinforcement learning. The method aims to improve sample efficiency and policy robustness by exploring multiple optimal paths to reach given goals. The approach shows significant improvements in achieving flexible goal-conditioned policies, thereby enhancing generalization and adaptability in novel environments.",
