    "description": "This paper presents a method for learning globally stable nonlinear dynamical systems as motion planning policies. It employs polynomial dynamical systems modeled as parametric polynomials and learns the polynomial’s coefficients jointly with a Lyapunov candidate. The method is compared against state-of-the-art approaches in simulations and real-world experiments with the Kinova Gen3 Lite manipulator arm.",
