    "description": "The paper proposes an exact solution method for the problem of optimizing assortment decisions in the presence of product-specific costs under the multinomial logit model (MNL). The authors present a bounding procedure based on the approximation method of Feldman and Topaloglu (2015a) to provide tight lower and upper bounds quickly. Additionally, the authors adapt their method to handle constraints such as cardinality or space/resource capacity, significantly improving computational efficiency over existing methods.",
