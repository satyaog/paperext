    "description": "The paper introduces GPS-SSL, a novel method for enhancing Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) by incorporating prior knowledge into the positive sample selection process. Unlike traditional SSL methods that rely heavily on data augmentations (DA), this approach creates a metric space where Euclidean distances serve as a proxy for semantic relationships, thereby reducing the dependency on finely-tuned augmentations. The method is validated through experiments on various datasets, including under-studied and real-world datasets, showing substantial performance improvements.",
