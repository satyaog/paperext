    "description": "This paper introduces a novel framework for learning 3D representations for perception tasks, specifically focusing on autonomous driving datasets. The proposed method, Semantically Tolerant SLidR (ST-SLidR), alleviates the issues of self-similarity and class imbalance commonly found in such datasets through a semantically tolerant contrastive loss and a class-agnostic balanced loss. The framework effectively utilizes 2D self-supervised image features to enhance 3D point cloud representations, improving performance in 3D semantic segmentation.",
