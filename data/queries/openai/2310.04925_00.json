    "description": "This paper introduces Crystal-GFN, a generative model for crystal structures that samples structural properties, such as space group, composition, and lattice parameters. The model incorporates physical and structural constraints and uses a proxy machine learning model to predict formation energy per atom. The results demonstrate Crystal-GFN's ability to sample diverse crystals with low predicted formation energy.",
