    "description": "This paper introduces STR2STR, a novel structure-to-structure translation framework designed for zero-shot conformation sampling of proteins. Leveraging an amortized denoising score matching objective trained on general crystal structures, STR2STR requires no reliance on simulation data for training or inference. STR2STR demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art generative models and is significantly faster than traditional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.",
