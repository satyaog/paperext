    "description": "The paper proposes an integrated sensing and communication technique to detect space debris for satellite mega-constellations. By using canonical polyadic (CP) tensor decomposition, the method estimates the number of paths (including both line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight) for debris detection. The tensor decomposition is solved using the alternating least square (ALS) algorithm and the results suggest that the proposed tensor-based method has a higher detection probability than conventional methods.",
