    "description": "The paper introduces PhotoBot, a framework that incorporates high-level human language guidance and a robot photographer. It uses visual language models and large language models to communicate photography suggestions through reference images, enabling automated photo acquisition by solving a perspective-n-point (PnP) problem for camera pose adjustments.",
