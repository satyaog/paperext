    "description": "This paper introduces a novel automatic metric for evaluating Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems called LAVE, which leverages the in-context learning capabilities of instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs). The metric aims to align more closely with human judgment compared to existing metrics like VQA Accuracy. LAVE is formulated as an answer-rating task where the LLM scores the correctness of a candidate answer given a question and a set of reference answers. The authors demonstrate that LAVE correlates better with human judgment across several VQA models and benchmarks and address VQA Accuracy's failure modes by capturing correct answers missed by traditional metrics.",
