    "description": "This paper proposes a systematic testing method to assess the robustness of CNNs trained for hyperspectral image classification. It introduces domain-specific metamorphic transformations and employs metaheuristic search algorithms to optimize synthetically-distorted inputs, aiming to expose the weaknesses of these models. The study demonstrates how fine-tuning CNNs with these failure-indicating transformations can significantly enhance their robustness.",
