The dataset comprises high-quality two-photon calcium imaging data of the apical dendrites and cell bodies of visual cortical pyramidal neurons in mice over multiple days. The purpose of this dataset is to enable neuroscientists to explore the differences between apical and somatic processing and plasticity.",
