    "description": "This article introduces a class of Nash games among Stackelberg players (NASP s), a class of simultaneous non-cooperative games where the players solve sequential Stackelberg games. The paper proves the complexity of deciding if a NASP admits a Nash equilibrium and proposes two algorithms to compute and select Nash equilibria or certify their non-existence. Applications in international energy markets are also discussed.",

      "quote": "This article introduces a class of Nash games among Stackelberg players (NASP s), namely, a class of simultaneous non-cooperative games where the players solve sequential Stackelberg games. Specifically, each player solves a Stackelberg game where a leader optimizes a (parametrized) linear objective function subject to linear constraints while its followers solve convex quadratic problems subject to the standard optimistic assumption. Although we prove that deciding if a NASP instance admits a Nash equilibrium is generally a Î£p2 -hard decision problem, we devise two exact and computationally-efficient algorithms to compute and select Nash equilibria or certify that no equilibrium exists."
