    "description": "This paper introduces the Recurrent Real-valued Neural Autoregressive Density Estimator (RRNADE), a novel model for online classification and density estimation of streaming data. Combining a neural Gaussian mixture density module with a recurrent module, RRNADE addresses challenges in online learning settings such as concept drift and temporal correlations. It outperforms several existing density-based and non-density-based online classification methods in various tasks and demonstrates the complementary benefits of its density and recurrent modules through an ablation study.",
