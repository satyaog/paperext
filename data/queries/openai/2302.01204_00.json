    "description": "The paper presents novel methods for change point detection in dynamic graphs using Laplacian spectra. The authors introduce Laplacian Anomaly Detection (LAD) for single-view graphs, which captures short-term and long-term dependencies. They also propose MultiLAD, an extension of LAD for multi-view dynamic graphs, which aggregates view-specific spectral summaries using the scalar power mean. The performance and robustness of these methods are validated through both synthetic and real-world experiments.",
