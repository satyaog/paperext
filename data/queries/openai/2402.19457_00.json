    "description": "This paper proposes COSMIC, a task-oriented evaluation approach for assessing summarizers based on their ability to generate summaries that are useful for downstream tasks. It introduces a metric based on mutual information and demonstrates its strong correlation with human judgment-based metrics and its effectiveness in predicting downstream task performance.",

      "quote": "We evaluate the quality of our approach in two ways. We show that summarizers that induce a summary distribution with higher MI with the source texts’ distribution are higher quality ... We examine how well MI predicts the performance of downstream tasks ..."
