    "description": "This paper presents an empirical study on the adoption of security practices in Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform, focusing on three major cloud providers: AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. The study involves scanning a sample of 812 open-source projects hosted on GitHub for policy implementation through static analysis with Checkov, categorizing and assessing the adoption of security practices, and investigating the correlation between GitHub repository popularity and security practice adoption.",
