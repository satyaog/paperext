    "description": "This paper discusses the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence, proposing that advancements in AI can be accelerated by drawing inspiration from neural computations and behaviors observed in animals. It introduces the concept of an 'embodied Turing test' for AI models to measure their performance against the adaptive, flexible, and efficient behaviors of animals.",
