    "description": "This paper explores self-supervised learning (SSL) for analyzing a unique database of infant cry recordings to detect neurological injury and identify cry triggers such as pain, hunger, and discomfort. The paper demonstrates that SSL pre-training, especially using SimCLR, performs significantly better than supervised pre-training for these tasks. It also explores SSL-based domain adaptation and compares various models and methodologies.",
