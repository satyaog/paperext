    "description": "The paper investigates the convergence of stochastic mirror descent (SMD) under interpolation in relatively smooth and smooth convex optimization. It introduces new convergence guarantees for SMD with a constant stepsize and proposes a new adaptive stepsize scheme—the mirror stochastic Polyak stepsize (mSPS). The results are supported by experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of mSPS.",
