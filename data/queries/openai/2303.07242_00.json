    "description": "The paper explores the challenges workers face when consenting to workplace wellbeing technologies, using a focus group study to reveal their concerns and expectations. It suggests interventions to support meaningful consent, drawing on critical computing and feminist scholarship to frame consent as a structural condition rather than an individual choice.",

      "value": "empirical",
      "justification": "The study involves collecting data from six multi-stakeholder focus groups involving 15 participants to understand their perspectives on consent to workplace wellbeing technologies.",
      "quote": "Using a hypothetical case to prompt reflection among six multi-stakeholder focus groups involving 15 participants, we explored participants’ expectations and capacity to consent to these technologies."
