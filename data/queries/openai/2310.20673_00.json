    "description": "The paper addresses the problem of model pruning in large deep learning models and its disparate impact on the performance of different data sub-groups. It proposes a constrained optimization approach that uses group-level accuracy gaps to directly address this issue. Experimental results show the approach's effectiveness across multiple models, datasets, and sparsity levels.",
