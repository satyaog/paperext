    "description": "The paper explores leveraging connections between Generative Flow Networks (GFNs) and reinforcement learning to create a new method called QGFN. This method combines GFN policies with action-value estimates (Q) to generate greedier sampling policies while maintaining diversity. Variants like p-greedy, p-quantile, and p-of-max are benchmarked on tasks such as molecule design, RNA design, and bit sequence generation, outperforming several baselines.",
