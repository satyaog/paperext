    "description": "The paper introduces Swift-DynGFN, a novel framework aimed at improving causal structure learning in Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) while addressing scalability challenges. The framework enhances the architecture of Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNet) to allow for better parallelization and computational efficiency. Empirical evaluations using real single-cell RNA velocity and synthetic datasets demonstrate the advancements in capturing causal structures in GRNs and scalability for larger systems.",
