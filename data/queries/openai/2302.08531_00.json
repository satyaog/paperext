    "description": "This paper proposes a new training objective and decoding objective for abstractive text summarization to improve the factuality of generated summaries. The training objective involves rejection learning to allow the model to reject unsupported text spans, and the decoding objective penalizes non-factual summaries using a regularization term. The proposed method is compared with five baseline models and shows significant improvement in both automatic and human evaluations.",
