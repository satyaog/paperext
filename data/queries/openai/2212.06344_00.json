    "description": "This paper presents a novel neural technique designed to select local sub-regions around a point on a 3D mesh that can be parameterized into 2D with low distortion. The method is driven by the need for effective interactive workflows used in decaling, texturing, or painting on 3D surfaces. Key innovations include a differentiable parameterization layer, a novel distortion-aware segmentation network, and a unique thresholded-distortion loss to achieve optimal segmentation and parameterization.",

      "quote": "We demonstrate a compelling interactive application of DA Wand in Fig. 1, in which different regions on the sorting hat mesh are iteratively selected and decaled. We show additional example textures in the supplemental... We design a novel near-developable segmentation dataset to initialize the weights of our segmentation network, with an automatic generation algorithm which can be run out of the box. We then train this network end-to-end on a dataset of unlabelled natural shapes using our parameterization layer with distortion and compactness priors."
