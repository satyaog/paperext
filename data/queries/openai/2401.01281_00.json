    "description": "This study investigates the effect of sagittal versus axial scanning on the quality of spinal cord functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (scfMRI) data. Utilizing a Philips Achieva 3T MRI scanner, the research compares metrics such as tSNR, Dice Coefficient, Reproducibility, and Sensitivity between the two scanning planes. The findings suggest that axial scanning is generally more advantageous for mitigating physiological noise and ensuring higher data quality.",
