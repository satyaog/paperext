Examples include DProx-clipped-SGD-shift and DProx-clipped-SSTM-shift. These methods demonstrate accelerated and high-probability convergence.",

Using similar ideas, we also develop new methods for composite and distributed variational inequalities and analyze the high-probability convergence of these methods."
