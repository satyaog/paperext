    "description": "This paper introduces a novel adaptive scheduling strategy called 'Spaced Scheduling' inspired by the spaced repetition learning method used by humans. This strategy aims to optimize the curriculum of training examples for large language models (LLMs) during instruction fine-tuning, leading to better performance, particularly in reasoning tasks, using less training data and minimizing catastrophic forgetting.",

(2009) on curriculum learning (CL) further developed and formalized the strategy of using a curriculum in machine learningâ€”based on ordering sequences of training examples, in a manner inspired by the ordering of tasks into increasing complexity in human education. In contrast to CL, here we propose and examine a strategy that is particularly well-suited to modern LLMs."

          "quote": "Spaced repetition (SR) is a learning technique from cognitive science that involves reviewing information at gradually increasing intervals over time, with early work on the subject dating back to Ebbinghaus (1885), and the well-known Ebbinghaus model of the forgetting curve. The spaced repetition methodology capitalizes on the spacing effect (Hintzman, 1974), a psychological principle that posits that our brains retain information more effectively when we learn in multiple, spread-out sessions."

For a comprehensive evaluation, we follow the setup proposed by Touvron et al. (2023) where each model is tested on five capabilities: code, commonsense reasoning, word knowledge, reading comprehension, and math. Each capability score represents an average over multiple tasks. Further, the models are tested on two popular benchmarks: Massive Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) (Hendrycks et al., 2020) and Big Bench Hard (BBH) (Suzgun et al., 2022). When evaluating the vanilla L LAMA -2 we use the non-chat prompt suggested by the original work (Touvron et al., 2023). It is worth noting Touvron et al. (2023) used proprietary evaluation code and the results we show in this work are reproduced using the BigCode LM-eval-harness for code capability6 and EleutherAI LM-eval-harness (Gao et al., 2021) 7 for the rest. Therefore, our results might differ from the original work Touvron et al. (2023). Nonetheless, since all the baselines and our approach are evaluated with the same method, the findings of our experiments remain valid."
