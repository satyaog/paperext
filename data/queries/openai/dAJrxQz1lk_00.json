    "description": "This paper introduces A*Net, a scalable path-based method for reasoning on large-scale knowledge graphs. It leverages the A* algorithm to learn a priority function that selects important nodes and edges during iterations, significantly reducing time and memory footprint in both training and inference. Empirical results on various benchmarks demonstrate A*Net's competitive performance and its ability to handle million-scale datasets efficiently.",
