    "description": "This paper presents \"gradient masked averaging\" (GMA) as a new aggregation technique in Federated Learning (FL). The goal of GMA is to address the issue of heterogeneous client data in FL by focusing on the invariant mechanisms across clients and ignoring spurious mechanisms, thereby improving the generalization of the global model. The technique can replace the standard averaging method in existing FL algorithms. Extensive experiments show that GMA consistently improves the performance of FL approaches.",
