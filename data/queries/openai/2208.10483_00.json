    "description": "This paper proposes a method to prioritize samples in reinforcement learning based on their learn-ability, defined as the steady decrease of training loss over time. The method aims to improve sample efficiency by focusing on samples with high reducible loss. The approach is empirically tested on benchmarks like DeepMind Control Suite, OpenAI Gym, MinAtar, and the Arcade Learning Environment.",
