    "description": "The paper reviews and empirically compares various optimization-based methods for estimating causal effects when randomized controlled trials or natural experiments are not feasible. It discusses how these methods balance the distributions of covariates between treated and control groups to eliminate bias and provides comparative results against other causal inference methods.",

      "quote": "We now discuss some of these results in more detail. First, note that the ebal and sbw methods fail to estimate the SATT on 3187 datasets, in contrast to the other four optimization-based methods. [...] In particular, the best method in Table 6 is a mixed method that uses the estimated propensity score as an additional covariate in the regression model of the response."
