    "description": "This paper introduces StarVector, a multimodal SVG generation model that utilizes Code Generation Large Language Models (CodeLLMs) and vision models to convert images into SVG code. The model employs a CLIP image encoder and StarCoder model to generate complex SVGs from pixel images. The paper also presents SVG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating SVG methods, and introduces datasets such as SVG-Emoji and SVG-Stack for pre-training and evaluation.",
