    "description": "This paper introduces 'Forecaster,' a deep hierarchical reinforcement learning approach designed to plan over high-level goals by leveraging a temporally abstract world model. The model aids in envisioning long-term outcomes by using a tree-search planning procedure. The approach is validated in the AntMaze domain for both single-task learning and generalization to new tasks.",
