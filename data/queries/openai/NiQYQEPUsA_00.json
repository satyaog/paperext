    "description": "This paper conducts a systematic study on using ensemble-based conservative optimization objectives to mitigate overoptimization in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). The study extends prior work by including label noise to better mirror real-world conditions. The results demonstrate that ensemble-based conservative optimization can effectively counter overoptimization and improve performance.",
