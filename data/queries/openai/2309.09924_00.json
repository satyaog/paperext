    "description": "In this paper, we introduce DYMAG: a message passing paradigm for GNNs built on the expressive power of continuous, multiscale graph-dynamics. DYMAG leverages complex graph dynamics based on the heat and wave equation as well as a more complex equation which admits chaotic solutions to generate multiscale representations linked to various graph topological and spectral properties. The approach achieves superior performance in tasks such as recovering generating parameters of random graphs and predicting features of biomolecules.",
