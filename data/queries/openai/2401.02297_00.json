    "description": "This paper evaluates the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) for spoken task-oriented dialogues, specifically using DSTC11 test sets. Due to the lack of a proper spoken dialogue dataset, the authors transcribed a set of spoken dialogues with an ASR engine, characterized ASR-error types, and simulated these errors in a larger dataset. They report the intrinsic and extrinsic performance of fine-tuned GPT-2 and T5 models in response generation and dialogue state tracking tasks, respectively.",
