    "description": "The paper evaluates how different scenarios for expanding protected areas to 30% of land by 2030 would capture the climatically viable ranges of Canadian terrestrial vertebrates, plants, and butterflies. It emphasizes the importance of national coordination to maximize biodiversity protection and minimize trade-offs among various conservation priorities.",
