    "description": "The paper analyzes the dynamics of streaming stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in high-dimensional limits when applied to generalized linear models and multi-index models with general data-covariance. It demonstrates a deterministic equivalent of SGD using ordinary differential equations (ODEs), provides learning rate thresholds for stability, and convergence guarantees. Additionally, a stochastic differential equation (SDE) with a simplified diffusion coefficient is introduced to analyze general statistics of SGD iterates.",
