    "description": "The paper introduces Tests of Accuracy with Random Points (TARP) as a method to estimate coverage probabilities of generative posterior estimators. It differentiates itself from previous methods by not requiring posterior evaluations. The theoretical foundation and empirical validation through various experiments are provided, including high-dimensional spaces and specific applications like gravitational lensing source reconstruction.",

      "quote": "We demonstrate the method on a variety of synthetic examples, and show that TARP can be used to test the results of posterior inference analyses in high-dimensional spaces. We also show that our method can detect inaccurate inferences in cases where existing methods fail."
