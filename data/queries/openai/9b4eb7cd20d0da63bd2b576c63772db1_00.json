    "description": "This paper investigates the cross-sectional and longitudinal neuroanatomical correlates of distinct clinical (adaptive) outcomes in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using a longitudinal follow-up study. The study examines how adaptive behavior in individuals with ASD is linked to variations in neuroanatomy, and explores potential genomic associates of these neuroanatomical differences.",
