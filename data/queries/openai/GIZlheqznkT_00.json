    "description": "This paper introduces SUNMASK, a generative sequence modeling approach based on masked unrolled denoising autoencoders. SUNMASK incorporates a conditional masking variable to modulate losses during training and control generation more finely. The framework is model-agnostic and uses both transformer and convolutional architectures, demonstrating effectiveness in tasks such as symbolic polyphonic music and English text language modeling.",
