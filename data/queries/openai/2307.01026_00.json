    "description": "This paper introduces the Temporal Graph Benchmark (TGB), which is designed to provide challenging and diverse benchmark datasets for evaluating machine learning models on temporal graphs. The benchmark aims to improve the robustness and reproducibility of evaluations, covering both node and edge-level prediction tasks. It also proposes improved evaluation protocols and includes an automated machine learning pipeline.",
