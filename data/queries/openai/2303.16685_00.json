    "description": "The paper addresses the challenge of load balancing in communication networks with unseen traffic scenarios by proposing a framework for policy reuse based on reinforcement learning. This method leverages a pre-trained policy bank and a policy selector that adapts to real-time traffic data, aiming to outperform traditional rule-based and adaptive methods.",
