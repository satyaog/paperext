    "description": "This tutorial presents a computational overview on computing Nash equilibria in Integer Programming Games (IPGs). It provides background, classifies state-of-the-art algorithms for these games, proposes a taxonomy of algorithmic ingredients needed for equilibrium computation, and compares different types of IPGs to highlight their properties.",

We propose an essential taxonomy of the algorithmic ingredients needed to compute equilibria, and we describe the theoretical and practical challenges associated with equilibria computation. Finally, we quantitatively and qualitatively compare a sequential Stackelberg game with a simultaneous IPG to highlight the different properties of their solutions."
