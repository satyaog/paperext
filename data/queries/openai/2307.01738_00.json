    "description": "The paper proposes a novel two-stage method called Cluster-Focal to address calibration biases in deep learning models for medical imaging analysis. This method identifies poorly calibrated samples, clusters them, and then applies a group-wise focal loss to improve calibration biases without needing predefined subgroup attributes. The approach is evaluated on skin lesion classification and predicting future lesional activity for multiple sclerosis patients, showing improved fairness and calibration performance compared to other methods.",
