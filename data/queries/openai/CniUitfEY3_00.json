    "description": "This paper introduces the Reusable Slotwise Mechanisms (RSM), a framework for modeling object dynamics by leveraging communication among slots with a modular architecture. RSM dynamically selects reusable mechanisms for predicting future states of each object slot, incorporating Central Contextual Information for complex interactions. Experimental results show RSM outperforms existing methods in various tasks, including Visual Question Answering and action planning, both in in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios.",
