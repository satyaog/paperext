    "description": "This paper introduces Iterated Denoising Energy Matching (iDEM), an algorithm designed to sample from Boltzmann distributions using a novel method that trains a diffusion-based sampler. It achieves this without the need for data samples, relying instead on the energy function and its gradient. iDEM is tested on various tasks, showcasing its ability to outperform existing methods in terms of sampling efficiency and quality.",
