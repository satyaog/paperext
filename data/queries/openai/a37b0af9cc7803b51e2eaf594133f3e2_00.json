    "description": "This paper investigates the effects of long-term synaptic plasticity on a biophysically detailed cortical network model. It integrates a calcium-based model of functional plasticity into a large-scale cortical network, simulates its activity under in vivo-like conditions, and analyzes the sparse and highly specific changes in synaptic efficacy. The findings emphasize the specificity of plastic changes and their consequences for network stability and function.",
