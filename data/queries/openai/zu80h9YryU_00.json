    "description": "The paper introduces the Physics-Informed Transformer (PIT) model, which leverages transformers for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) without requiring ground truth solutions for training. PIT aims to improve generalization and flexibility over traditional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) by utilizing attention mechanisms. The model is tested on the 1D Burgers’ and the 2D Heat equations, demonstrating significant improvement over standard PINNs with negligible computational overhead.",
