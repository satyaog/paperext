    "description": "This paper aims to use a data-driven model to learn an effective evolution equation for particle-mesh simulations, focusing on correcting errors in the particle-mesh potential at small scales. The approach helps in producing evolution equations that generalize well to new initial conditions and cosmologies, thereby improving the accuracy of simulations for cosmological parameter inference.",

      "quote": "In the present work, we show that it is possible to obtain an effective evolution equation that is robust to variations in cosmological parameters and initial conditions in a physically principled manner, by only imposing loss terms at the level of the position and velocities of the particles, effectively enforcing the conservation of global angular and linear momenta."
