    "description": "This paper presents new methods for solving Dynamic Maximum Covering Location Problems (MCLP). Specifically, the authors expand upon the existing Benders decomposition approach and introduce a specialized local branching scheme to tackle the problem over multiple time periods. The methods are validated through computational experiments using real-life data on the placement of electric vehicle charging stations.",
