    "description": "This paper explores how ischemic strokes impact men and women differently with regard to language impairments, focusing on the left-dominant language network. Using Bayesian methods, the researchers model the degree of sex divergence in 1401 patients to predict language outcomes approximately 3 months post-stroke. Key findings show sex-specific brain-behavior associations, emphasizing the need for personalized treatment plans for stroke patients.",
