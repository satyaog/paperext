    "description": "This paper investigates the impact of different self-supervised learning objectives (joint-embedding and reconstruction-based) on Vision Transformer (ViT) representations. The study analyzes how these objectives influence the structure and transferability of learned representations, revealing differences in feature similarity and class discriminative information across the network layers. The research also explores how fine-tuning affects the reorganization of information in the representations.",

      "justification": "The paper conducts an empirical analysis involving experiments with various models and pre-training objectives to study their impact on Vision Transformer representations.",
      "quote": "Here, we aim to explain these differences by analyzing the impact of these objectives on the structure and transferability of the learned representations. Our analysis reveals that reconstruction-based learning features are significantly dissimilar to joint-embedding based learning features and that models trained with similar objectives learn similar features even across architectures."
