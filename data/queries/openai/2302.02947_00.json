    "description": "The paper presents GPS++, a hybrid model combining Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNN) and Graph Transformers. It achieves state-of-the-art results on the PCQM4Mv2 dataset for molecular property prediction by combining local message passing with global attention mechanisms. The study also emphasizes the competitiveness of MPNNs in the presence and absence of 3D positional information.",
