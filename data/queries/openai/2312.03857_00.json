    "description": "The paper proposes a novel Population Monte Carlo (PMC) algorithm that utilizes normalizing flow to construct expressive proposal distributions for adaptive importance sampling (AIS). The algorithm significantly improves sampling efficiency in high-dimensional probability distributions compared to existing techniques. The authors demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in both synthetic and real-world Bayesian inference problems.",
