    "description": "Cell-type composition is an important indicator of health. The study presents Guided Topic Model for deconvolution (GTM-decon) to automatically infer cell-type-specific gene topic distributions from single-cell RNA-seq data for deconvolving bulk transcriptomes. GTM-decon performs competitively on deconvolving simulated and real bulk data compared with the state-of-the-art methods. It demonstrates the capability of inferring multiple cell-type-specific gene topic distributions per cell type, capturing sub-cell-type variations, and using phenotype labels to infer phenotype-specific gene distributions. It identified cell-type-specific differentially expressed genes from bulk breast cancer transcriptomes.",
