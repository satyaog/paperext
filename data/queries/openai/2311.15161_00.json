    "description": "This paper proposes the Hessian Aware Low-Rank Perturbation (HALRP) algorithm aimed at enhancing continual learning. The method models parameter transitions along sequential tasks using weight matrix transformations and applies low-rank approximations to task-adaptive parameters in neural networks' layers. The study includes theoretical insights on the relationship between the Hessian matrix and low-rank approximations, and proposes a pruning technique to maintain model capacity. The work is validated through extensive experiments demonstrating the method's effectiveness and scalability, especially in addressing task order robustness and the forgetting issue in continual learning.",
