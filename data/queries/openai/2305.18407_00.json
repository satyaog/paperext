    "description": "The paper proposes MoleculeSDE, a novel pretraining method using group symmetric stochastic differential equation models for generating 3D geometries from 2D topologies and vice versa, directly in the input space. It aims to enhance molecule representation in AI-based drug discovery by retaining more structural information. The approach is shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on several downstream tasks.",
