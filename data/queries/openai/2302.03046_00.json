    "description": "The paper introduces Score-based LIkelihood Characterization (SLIC), a framework for building a data-driven noise model using noise realizations from observations. SLIC uses diffusion generative models to estimate the gradient of the probability density of noise and Langevin sampling to produce independent samples from the likelihood. The framework is demonstrated using real data from the Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope.",
