    "description": "The paper explores the necessity of including reliable detection mechanisms in generative AI models, specifically foundation models, as a requirement for their public release. It argues that such mechanisms are technically feasible and crucial for reducing the risks associated with AI-generated content, particularly in distinguishing between human-generated and AI-generated content. The authors also discuss potential methods for implementing detection tools and propose high-level legislative guidelines for their mandatory inclusion.",
