    "description": "The paper introduces the concept of continuous Markov Decision Process (MDP) homomorphisms for reinforcement learning (RL) in continuous state and action spaces. It derives a policy gradient theorem on the abstract MDP and proposes actor-critic algorithms that learn policies and MDP homomorphisms simultaneously. The effectiveness of these methods is demonstrated on various tasks with symmetries, including visual control tasks, using environments from the DeepMind Control Suite.",

Finally, we show how to collapse an MDP when there is a group of symmetries which is also continuous. Thus, for example if a system is spherically symmetric the system is invariant under the action of the rotation group SO(3) and this is certainly not a finite group. Discrete symmetries can and do occur in continuous systems but in general one will be dealing with continuous symmetries. Additionally, to demonstrate the ability of DHPG in learning continuous symmetries, we have developed a series of environments with continuous symmetries.In summary, our contributions can be listed as:"
