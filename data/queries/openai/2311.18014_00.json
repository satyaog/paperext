    "description": "The paper presents a methodology for deconvolving intrinsic X-ray spectra from the instrumental response using a Recurrent Inference Machine (RIM). The methodology is applied to the galaxy cluster Abell 1550, using synthetic data from state-of-the-art thermodynamic models and response matrices from the Chandra X-ray Observatory archive. The RIM demonstrates high accuracy in reconstructing intrinsic spectra, which can further be used for multiple science applications.",
