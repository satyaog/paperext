    "description": "This paper focuses on enhancing the robustness of task-oriented dialogue agents by augmenting them with workflow names and action plans. Specifically, the paper illustrates the utilization of text2text transformers like T5-small, base, and large to improve the models' ability to generalize to unseen workflows and actions. Extensive experiments are conducted using the Action-Based Conversations Dataset (ABCD).",
