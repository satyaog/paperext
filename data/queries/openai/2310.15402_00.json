    "description": "The paper presents a method for contrast-agnostic soft segmentation of the spinal cord using MRI images. The method leverages a dataset consisting of multiple contrasts and introduces a novel pipeline for generating soft ground truth segmented images. This pipeline includes preprocessing of data, dataset augmentation, and a unique loss function centered around regression (specifically, adaptive wing loss). The proposed model is tested against state-of-the-art methods and demonstrates superior performance in reducing cross-sectional area (CSA) variability across different contrasts and shows remarkable generalization capabilities to unseen data, including images with various spinal pathologies.",
