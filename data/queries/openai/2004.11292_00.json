    "description": "This paper presents a statistical approach to predict travel time on transportation networks using large-scale GPS data. The authors develop methods to estimate the distribution of travel time over a route, providing asymptotically tight prediction intervals. The approach is demonstrated using real-world GPS data from Quebec City.",
