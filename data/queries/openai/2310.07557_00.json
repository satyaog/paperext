    "description": "The paper addresses the challenges of flow allocation and scheduling in high-throughput satellites (HTSs) within mega constellations. It focuses on improving internal routing to handle high data rates and ensure reliable quality of service (QoS). The authors introduce a Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach tailored to manage dynamic and uncertain incoming data flows, providing a predictive model for optimal routing decisions. Through numerical simulations, the method demonstrates close-to-optimal performance in minimizing packet loss and maintaining QoS.",
