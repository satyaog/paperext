    "description": "This paper investigates the permutation symmetries in neural networks, particularly focusing on the concept of linear mode connectivity. The authors refine existing arguments into three distinct claims about permutation symmetries and provide empirical evidence for these claims. The concept of simultaneous weak linear connectivity is introduced, and evidence for the potential of strong linear connectivity is also discussed, especially as the network width increases.",

      "quote": "We verify simultaneous connectivity for sequences of networks resulting from SGD training trajectories, as well as sequences of networks resulting from iterative magnitude pruning (IMP). Finally, we provide the first support for the existence of strong connectivity, by showing that barriers among permuted network triplets reduce as network width increases."
