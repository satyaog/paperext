    "description": "The paper introduces Tree-Based Regularization (TBR), an approach for disentangled representation learning leveraging sparsity and hierarchical relationships across environments. It models sparse changes in the mapping from latent variables to target variables across related environments, particularly suitable for biological settings. Theoretical and empirical analyses demonstrate that TBR improves recovery of latent causal variables and enhances predictive performance.",
