    "description": "This paper presents BootIfOL, a novel algorithm within the Imitation from Observation (IfO) paradigm. It focuses on training autonomous agents in a Markov Decision Process (MDP) using only visual demonstrations of expert trajectories. This approach leverages contrastive learning to derive a reward function that measures the similarity between agent and expert behaviors. The primary goal is to improve the agent's learning efficiency and effectiveness in various control tasks using a limited number of expert demonstrations.",
