    "description": "This paper focuses on Joint Embedding Self-Supervised Learning (JE-SSL). It challenges several preconceptions about the necessity of large mini-batches and strong data augmentations for training JE-SSL models. The paper introduces a novel PyTorch library named FFCV-SSL specifically optimized for Self-Supervised Learning to make these models more accessible.",
