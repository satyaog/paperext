    "description": "The paper explores the incorporation of depth signals into the Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) framework. Using a pretrained state-of-the-art monocular RGB-to-depth model, it investigates two distinct approaches: appending the depth channel to the RGB and generating novel views using depth data. The researchers evaluate these methods using three SSL algorithms—BYOL, SimSiam, and SwAV—on datasets like ImageNette, ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1k. They find that both methods improve the robustness and generalization of SSL models.",
