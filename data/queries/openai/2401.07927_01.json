    "description": "The paper investigates the faithfulness of self-explanations generated by instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs). It proposes a method to measure faithfulness using self-consistency checks across different models and datasets. The findings indicate that faithfulness is highly model and task-dependent, suggesting that self-explanations from LLMs should not be trusted in general.",

      "value": "Empirical",
      "justification": "The study evaluates the faithfulness of self-explanations from LLMs using various empirical methods, including self-consistency checks and evaluations on multiple datasets.",
      "quote": "The task dependence is concerning as it means LLM self-explanations cannot generally be trusted. There is also no reason to trust more free-form explanations where faithfulness can not be evaluated using self-consistency checks. This increases the risk with LLMs, as individuals may have the misconception that LLMs can explain themselves"

        "justification": "The paper deals with the evaluation of Large Language Models, which is a core topic in Deep Learning.",
        "quote": "To solve these challenges, we propose a faithfulness metric that only uses an inference API and takes advantage of the model’s reluctance to answer when critical information is missing. We achieve this by limiting the scope of self-explanations to those verifiable using self-consistency checks and by carefully prompting the model regarding both the explanation and classification generation."

          "quote": "Therefore, it’s important to measure if self-explanations truly reflect the model’s behavior. Such a measure is called interpretability-faithfulness and is challenging to perform since the ground truth is inaccessible, and many LLMs only have an inference API."
