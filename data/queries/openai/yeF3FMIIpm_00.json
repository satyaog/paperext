    "description": "The paper proposes a novel training procedure called CrossSplit to mitigate the memorization of noisy labels. It involves training two neural networks on disjoint parts of the labeled dataset, using cross-split label correction and cross-split semi-supervised training. The method is validated through extensive experiments.",
