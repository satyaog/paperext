    "description": "This paper explores the capability of large language models (LLMs) in generating literature reviews for scientific research papers, particularly focusing on a novel strategy of creating an intermediate plan before generating the actual text. The study demonstrates that this intermediate planning step improves the quality of the literature reviews generated by LLMs compared to vanilla zero-shot generation. Additionally, the authors introduce a new corpus consisting of recent arXiv papers and extend the existing Multi-XScience dataset to include full-text research papers rather than just abstracts.",
