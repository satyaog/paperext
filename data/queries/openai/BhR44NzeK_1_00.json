    "description": "This paper introduces GraphCG, an unsupervised method for discovering steerable factors in graph data. The method is model-agnostic and task-agnostic and leverages mutual information maximization to identify semantic directions in the graph data's latent space. The paper evaluates the method on molecular graphs and point clouds, demonstrating its effectiveness in discovering meaningful semantic directions.",

We summarize our contributions as follows: (1) We conduct an empirical study on the disentanglement property of three pretrained deep generative models (DGMs) on two types of graph data, molecular graphs and point clouds. We find that the latent space of these pretrained graph DGMs is not perfectly disentangled. (2) We propose a model-agnostic and task-agnostic method called GraphCG for the unsupervised graph controllable generation. GraphCG aims at learning the semantic directions by maximizing their corresponding mutual information, and its outputs are sequences of graphs. (3) We evaluate the proposed methods on two types of graph data, molecular graphs and point clouds. The experimental results show the clear improvement (up to 3 times better in SMC) over the baselines."
