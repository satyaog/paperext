    "description": "This paper proposes a natural extension to E(n)-equivariant graph neural networks (EGNN) that uses multiple equivariant vectors per node. The multichannel EGNN is shown to improve performance across different physical systems benchmark tasks with minimal differences in runtime and number of parameters. The tasks include N-body charged particle dynamics, molecular property predictions, and predicting the trajectories of solar system bodies.",
