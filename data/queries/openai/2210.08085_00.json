    "description": "This paper investigates the ability of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents to perform adaptive patch foraging in an ecological environment, comparing their behavior to that of biological foragers and the optimal patch foraging behavior. The study reveals that DRL agents can learn adaptive patch foraging patterns similar to biological agents and approach the optimal solution when accounting for temporal discounting. The paper also examines the internal dynamics of these agents, finding similarities with the neural recordings from foraging non-human primates.",

This value comparison\nrequires multiscale temporal resolutions, both local and global, which can be difficult to represent using\nmodel-free reinforcement learning, but are seen in animal cognition and neural dynamics (Badman et al.,\n2020)."
