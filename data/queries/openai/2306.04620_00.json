    "description": "This paper proposes the use of goal-conditioned GFlowNets to tackle the multi-objective molecular design problem, enabling more fine-grained control over trade-offs. By conditioning the Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) on specific goal regions in the objective space, the approach aims to achieve a more comprehensive and evenly distributed Pareto front of solutions, addressing issues present in previously scalarized single-objective models.",
