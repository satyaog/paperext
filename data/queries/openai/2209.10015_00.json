    "description": "This paper presents a unified framework called Metadata Archaeology via Probe Dynamics (MAP-D) for uncovering and inferring metadata of data examples in a dataset. The approach involves curating different subsets of data based on training dynamics, such as mislabeled, atypical, or out-of-distribution examples, and then leveraging differences in learning dynamics to infer metadata. The method is shown to be competitive with more complex solutions in a range of tasks, including identifying and correcting mislabeled examples, classifying minority-group samples, and prioritizing points relevant for training.",
