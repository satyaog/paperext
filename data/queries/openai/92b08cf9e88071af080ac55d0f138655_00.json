    "description": "The paper introduces TINDL, a deep learning framework developed to predict the anti-cancer drug response and identify biomarkers using preclinical cancer cell lines. TINDL employs a tissue-informed normalization to account for tissue and cancer type variations and addresses statistical discrepancies between cell lines and patient tumors. The framework enhances prediction accuracy and facilitates identification of predictive biomarkers, validated through experiments and comparison with existing models.",
