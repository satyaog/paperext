    "description": "In this paper, two algorithms are proposed to adjust fitted ML predictors to produce decisions that are fair. The paper implements machine learning methodologies considering causal models of ML decisions to define counterfactual fairness and equal opportunity. These algorithms focus on post-hoc adjustments to existing predictors without the need for retraining. The efficacy of these algorithms is demonstrated on datasets involving admissions, income, credit, and recidivism.",
