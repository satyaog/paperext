    "description": "The paper addresses the problem of multi-label text classification under limited supervision settings. The proposed methodology makes use of a pre-trained language model for preliminary label predictions and updates these predictions using a signed label dependency graph. This graph is computed from label descriptions and is leveraged through message passing techniques. The model is particularly focused on settings where annotation data is scarce or unavailable.",
