    "description": "The paper explores the scalability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for molecular graph reasoning. It compares message-passing networks, graph Transformers, and hybrid models on large-scale molecular datasets to analyze the impact of scale on performance. The study finds that increasing model size, dataset size, and diversity result in significant performance gains, paving the way for foundational GNNs in pharmaceutical drug discovery.",
