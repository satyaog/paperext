    "description": "This paper introduces BALAUR, a model that improves the performance of large transformer-based language models on tasks informed by lexical semantic relations (LSRs) such as hypernymy, synonymy, and antonymy. The model achieves this by integrating LSRs into the hidden states of language models throughout pretraining. The authors validate their approach with various evaluations, showing superior performance on hypernymy-informed tasks and the original language modeling objective. Additionally, the paper contributes a new dataset, HYPCC, for evaluating hypernymy-based cloze prompts.",
