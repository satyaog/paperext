    "description": "The paper introduces a novel variational pseudo-likelihood framework, ProtIR, for protein function prediction. This framework iteratively refines predictors and retrievers to improve accuracy. The study benchmarks retriever-based methods against predictors on protein function tasks, demonstrating that retriever-based approaches can achieve comparable or superior performance without massive pre-training. Integrating structural information into protein language models further enhances function annotation capabilities.",
