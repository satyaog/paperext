    "description": "This paper presents R-U-SURE (Randomized Utility-driven Synthesis of Uncertain REgions), a framework for uncertainty-aware code suggestions leveraging decision-theoretic models of utility to predict which parts of automatically generated code are most uncertain. The system can be applied to various developer-assistance tasks without retraining the foundational code generation models, leading to more accurate uncertainty estimations than existing token-probability based methods.",

      "quote": "We demonstrate R-U-SURE on three developer-assistance tasks, and show that it can be applied in different user interaction patterns without retraining the model and leads to more accurate uncertainty estimates than token-probability baselines."
