    "description": "The paper presents Continuous Kernel Graph Convolution (CKGConv), a novel and general graph convolution framework by parameterizing the kernels as continuous functions of pseudo-coordinates derived via graph positional encoding. It demonstrates that CKGConv is flexible, expressive, and can outperform existing graph convolutional networks while performing comparably to state-of-the-art graph transformers across various graph datasets.",
