    "description": "This paper introduces a novel method named PROTEIN SEQUENCE AND STRUCTURE CO-DESIGN WITH EQUIVARIANT TRANSLATION (PROTSEED) to co-design protein sequences and structures by iteratively translating both into a desirable state based on context features. The method incorporates a trigonometry-aware encoder and a roto-translation equivariant decoder to accelerate the inference process. Experimental results demonstrate that PROTSEED achieves state-of-the-art results across various protein design tasks while significantly improving inference times.",
