    "description": "This research paper presents an approach to improve GPT-3 embeddings using a Siamese structure for the task of detecting duplicate posts in technical forums. The method leverages GPT-3's semantic understanding and refines it through a Siamese-based network, utilizing duplicate labels from Stack Overflow to enhance the embeddings' capacity to capture duplicate relations. The results show significant improvements in duplicate detection performance, highlighting the method's efficacy and scalability.",
