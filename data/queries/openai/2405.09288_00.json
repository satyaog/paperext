    "description": "This paper introduces DeCoDEx, a framework that leverages an external, pre-trained binary artifact detector to guide a diffusion-based counterfactual image generator, significantly improving explainability by steering the generation away from spurious correlations and towards causal pathology markers. The framework is demonstrated with experiments on the CheXpert dataset, showing substantial improvements in classifier performance for underrepresented groups.",
