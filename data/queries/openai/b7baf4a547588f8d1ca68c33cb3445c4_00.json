    "description": "This paper investigates how different finetuning setups affect the ability of pretrained sequence-to-sequence language models, such as BART and T5, to replicate constituency tests, which involve manipulating sentence constituents. The authors propose multiple evaluation settings and show that while models can replicate linguistic transformations on sentences seen during finetuning, their performance degrades on unseen sentence types, indicating a lack of systematic generalization. The results suggest that models often learn surface-level cues rather than constituent-level syntactic structures.",
