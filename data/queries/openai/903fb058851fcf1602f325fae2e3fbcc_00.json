    "description": "This paper proposes a meta-learning framework to rapidly optimize personalized neurostimulation parameters, focusing on the physiological modeling of fiber recruitment during vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). The framework leverages past data to improve efficiency in new subject parameter fitting, demonstrating effectiveness on both experimental and synthetic datasets.",
    "type": {
      "value": "Empirical Study",
      "justification": "The research empirically tests the proposed meta-learning framework on both real experimental data and synthetic datasets to validate its performance.",
      "quote": "Using additional synthetic data sets to complement experimental results, we demonstrate that our meta-learning framework is capable of directly modeling the physiology-eCAP relationship for individual subjects with much fewer individually queried data points than standard methods."

Due to variability arising from placement of stimulation devices, underlying neuroanatomy and physiological responses to stimulation, it is essential that neurostimulation protocols are personalized to maximize efficacy and safety."
