    "description": "The paper validates the use of the Pontomedullary Junction (PMJ) as a reference point for measuring spinal cord cross-sectional area (CSA) across different neck positions using MRI. It compares the variability and reliability of CSA measurements using PMJ-based methods against traditional vertebral level-based references.",

      "quote": "The goal of this study was to determine if the variability of CSA across neck flexions/extensions is reduced when using the PMJ, compared to vertebral levels. Ten participants underwent a 3T MRI T2w isotropic scan at 0.6 ­mm3 for 3 neck positions: extension, neutral and flexion."
