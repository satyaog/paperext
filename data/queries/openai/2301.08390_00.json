    "description": "This paper addresses the Few-Shot Open-Set Recognition (FSOSR) problem, which involves classifying instances from classes with few labeled samples and simultaneously detecting instances that do not belong to any known class. The authors propose a method called Open-Set Likelihood Optimization (OSLO), which generalizes the maximum likelihood principle by introducing latent scores to down-weigh potential outliers along with the usual parametric model. This method leverages both support and unlabelled query sets and improves the accuracy of inlier classification and outlier detection.",
