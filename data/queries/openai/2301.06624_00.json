    "description": "This paper presents TAAL, a novel semi-supervised active learning approach for medical image segmentation that leverages test-time data augmentation. The method uses cross-augmentation consistency to improve model learning and identify the most relevant unlabeled samples for annotation. The approach is validated on cardiac MRI data, showing significant performance improvements over baseline methods.",
