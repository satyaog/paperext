    "description": "This research paper conducts an empirical study analyzing questions from Stack Overflow and using LLMs (ChatGPT and LLaMA) to address them. The paper aims to measure user engagement evolution with Stack Overflow, quantify the reliability of LLMs’ answers, identify why LLMs fail, and compare these models. It evaluates the potential of these models as replacements for Stack Overflow and discusses their strengths and limitations.",
