    "description": "This paper introduces 'planning tokens' to improve the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in solving math word problems. The approach embeds these tokens into the model, guiding it at each reasoning step. The method is tested on various LLMs and math problem datasets, demonstrating notable accuracy improvements while requiring negligible additional trainable parameters.",
