    "description": "The paper proposes DynGFN, a novel framework for Bayesian structure learning under the lens of dynamical system identification for modeling complex posteriors over cyclic graphs. It uses Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to estimate the posterior distribution over sparse dependencies in a gene regulatory network, incorporating RNA velocity data.",
