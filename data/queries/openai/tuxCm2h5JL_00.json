    "description": "This paper explores the use of cognitive models as simulators to provide AI systems with implicit human feedback. Instead of interacting with real humans, AI systems interact with cognitive models, making the training process safer, cheaper, and faster. The study focuses on the context of learning fair behavior in the Ultimatum Game by training reinforcement learning (RL) agents to respond to various emotional states of a simulated responder.",
