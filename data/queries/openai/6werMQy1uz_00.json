    "description": "This research addresses the buyer's inspection paradox for information markets by introducing an open-source simulated marketplace where language agents inspect, value, and purchase information. These agents have capabilities to assess information quality and limit unauthorized retention by forgetting non-purchased data. The paper investigates biases in language models, the impact of pricing, and how higher budgets and inspections can lead to higher quality outcomes.",

      "value": "Empirical study",

      "quote": "Concretely, our experiments (a) uncover biases in language models leading to irrational behavior and evaluate techniques to mitigate these biases, (b) investigate how price affects demand in the context of informational goods, and (c) show that inspection and higher budgets both lead to higher quality outcomes."
