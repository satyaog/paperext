    "description": "This paper proposes a flexible framework for variable selection in time-dependent Cox models. It introduces the ‘sox’ package, which implements a network flow algorithm to efficiently solve models with complex covariate structures. The methodology is demonstrated through simulations and a case study on predictors of time to all-cause death in atrial fibrillation patients.",
