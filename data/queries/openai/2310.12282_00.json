    "description": "This paper presents a model for games among teams where each team consists of a homogeneous population of cooperative agents that compete with other teams. The authors propose a refinement of the Team-Nash equilibrium called mean-field Markov perfect equilibrium (MF-MPE) and demonstrate an approximation for large numbers of players.",
