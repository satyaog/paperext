    "description": "The paper introduces ChainForge, an open-source visual toolkit designed for prompt engineering and on-demand hypothesis testing of text generation large language models (LLMs). It provides a graphical interface for model comparison and prompt variation, supporting tasks like model selection, prompt template design, and hypothesis testing.",
