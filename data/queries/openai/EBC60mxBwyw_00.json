    "description": "This paper investigates how variance and bias in gradient estimators affect learning performance in artificial neural networks, particularly in the context of computational neuroscience and neuromorphic computing. The study shows that some level of variance and bias may improve generalization, while excessive amounts hinder learning. The investigation is supported by both analytical and empirical approaches.",

This matters for understanding generalization because the flatness of the loss landscape is a good proxy for generalization: flatter minima tend to have better generalization performance than sharper ones. We leverage this viewpoint to understand the impact of variance and bias on generalization."
