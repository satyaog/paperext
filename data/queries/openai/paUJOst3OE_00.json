    "description": "This paper proposes a model-adaptive prompt optimizer (MAPO) approach to refine prompts for specific large language models (LLMs) to enhance their performance across various natural language processing (NLP) downstream tasks. The paper quantitatively demonstrates the necessity of adapting prompts to different LLMs and utilizes supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to establish optimized prompts. Extensive experiments show significant improvements in LLM performance via MAPO.",
