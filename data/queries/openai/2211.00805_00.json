    "description": "The paper proposes a new method, Geodesic Sinkhorn, which combines the Sinkhorn algorithm with geodesic distances based on heat kernels to efficiently compute optimal transport distances on manifolds. The method improves computational efficiency, reduces memory usage, and provides better interpolation accuracy for large and high-dimensional datasets. The authors also introduce a novel concept called barycentric distance to compare families of distributions, demonstrating its utility in assessing treatment effects on high-dimensional single-cell data.",
