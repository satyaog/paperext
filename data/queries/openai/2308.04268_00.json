    "description": "The paper provides a comprehensive review of Teacher-Student architectures for various knowledge distillation (KD) objectives, including knowledge compression, expansion, adaptation, and enhancement. It discusses different knowledge representations and optimization objectives, summarizes representative learning algorithms and effective distillation schemes, and explores recent applications of Teacher-Student architectures in multiple domains such as classification, recognition, generation, ranking, and regression. The paper aims to provide insights and guidelines for designing, learning, and applying Teacher-Student architectures across various distillation objectives.",
