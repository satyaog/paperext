    "description": "This paper presents NollySenti, a new sentiment classification dataset based on Nollywood movie reviews for five widely spoken languages in Nigeria: English, Hausa, Igbo, Nigerian-Pidgin, and Yorùbá. The research explores the effectiveness of transfer learning and machine translation for cross-domain and cross-lingual sentiment classification in low-resource languages.",
