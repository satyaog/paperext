    "description": "The paper presents a framework for human state estimation in indoor environments using Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) sensors. The system can estimate the location, activities, and number of people in a given area without requiring them to carry any specific device. This is achieved by leveraging convolutional deep neural networks that map UWB Channel Impulse Responses (CIRs) to precise estimates of human location and activity.",
