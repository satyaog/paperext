    "description": "This paper introduces Listenable Maps for Audio Classifiers (L-MAC), a posthoc interpretation method designed to generate listenable and faithful interpretations for pretrained audio classifiers. L-MAC employs a decoder that produces binary masks over the spectrogram of the original input audio. These masks identify relevant portions of the audio that influenced the classifier's decision. The decoder is trained using a loss function that promotes high classifier confidence for the masked-in audio and low probability for the masked-out portions. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that L-MAC outperforms several existing methods, including gradient and masking-based techniques, in producing faithful and user-preferred interpretations.",

      "quote": "Quantitative evaluations on both in-domain and out-of-domain data demonstrate that L-MAC consistently produces more faithful interpretations than several gradient and masking-based methodologies. Furthermore, a user study confirms that, on average, users prefer the interpretations generated by the proposed technique."
