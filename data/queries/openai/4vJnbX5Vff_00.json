    "description": "This paper introduces a novel form of identifiability, termed quantized coordinate identifiability. The authors prove that it's possible to recover discretized latent coordinates under a highly generic nonlinear smooth mapping, assuming that latent density has axis-aligned discontinuity landmarks. This relaxes the usual assumptions on the independence of factors or the form of the mapping, contributing to disentanglement and representation learning theories.",
