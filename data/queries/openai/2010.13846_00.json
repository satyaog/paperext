    "description": "This paper presents LEAD, a novel optimizer for min-max games inspired by a physical framework. It leverages tools from physics to improve the optimization dynamics of adversarial games, such as GANs. The method demonstrates linear convergence using stability theory and spectral analysis and achieves compelling empirical results on synthetic setups and CIFAR-10 image generation.",
