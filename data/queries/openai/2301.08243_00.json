    "description": "This paper introduces the Image-based Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (I-JEPA), a non-generative method for self-supervised learning from images aimed at producing semantic image representations. The proposed method uses a single context block to predict the representations of target blocks in the same image. The authors explore this approach using Vision Transformers and test it across various tasks, including image classification, object counting, and depth prediction.",
