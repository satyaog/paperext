    "description": "This paper presents PySCFIPU, a hardware-accelerated adaptation of the PySCF library optimized for creating large DFT datasets. The authors introduce a new dataset, QM10X, and demonstrate its efficiency by training a SchNet model. The paper explores the impact of dataset size on neural network performance and highlights how PySCFIPU addresses computational challenges in DFT calculations.",
