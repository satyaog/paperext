    "description": "This paper studies the genetic diversity and selective pressures in human populations focusing on the CYP3A and CYP4F gene clusters. It uses datasets from the 1000 Genomes Project to identify co-evolution and co-regulation signatures, highlighting the genetic differentiation and evolutionary forces at play within these gene families.",

      "quote": "In this study, we investigate the genetic diversity of CYP450 genes. We found that two clusters, CYP3A and CYP4F, are notably differentiated across human populations with evidence for selective pressures acting on both clusters."
