    "description": "In this paper, the authors address the problem of optimal control in decentralized linear quadratic systems with both major and minor agents, under the presence of non-Gaussian noise. Specifically, they characterize the structure of the optimal strategy and the best linear strategy for both types of agents. The results show how the optimal control actions and estimations can be achieved even when facing non-Gaussian noise, providing both theoretical insights and practical algorithms for implementation in systems like unmanned aerial vehicles and robotics.",
