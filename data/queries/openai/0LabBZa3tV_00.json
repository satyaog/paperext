    "description": "This research paper presents a new approach called Meta-Value Learning (MeVa) to enhance multi-agent systems. The method builds upon the LOLA framework but introduces a more comprehensive value-based optimization strategy that considers empirical observations of the effects of optimization. The core of the method is the meta-value function, which provides a reliable direction for optimization by looking ahead at future optimization steps.",

It nevertheless does appear to converge reliably in practice, and we conjecture that applying it on the level of optimization effectively simplifies the interaction between the agents’ learning processes."
