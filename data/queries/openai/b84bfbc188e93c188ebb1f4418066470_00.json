    "description": "The paper discusses the impact of quantitative approaches, including predictive modelling, population genetics, machine learning, and dimensionality reduction techniques, on understanding the COVID-19 pandemic, especially focusing on the within-host immune response to SARS-CoV-2. It reviews the mathematical, computational, and machine learning techniques applied to various aspects of COVID-19, providing insights into COVID-19 severity, treatment, vaccine development, and viral evolution.",

      "value": "empirical",
      "justification": "The paper reviews empirical studies and applications of mathematical and computational models to provide insights into the COVID-19 pandemic, rather than developing new theoretical models.",
      "quote": "Here we provide perspectives on what has been accomplished using quantitative methods, including predictive modelling, population genetics, machine learning, and dimensionality reduction techniques, in the first 26 months of the COVID-19 pandemic approaches, and where we go from here to improve our responses to this and future pandemics."
