    "description": "The paper proposes a method called Action Limited PreTraining (ALPT) which combines large but sparsely-annotated datasets from a target environment of interest with fully-annotated datasets from various other source environments. This method significantly improves game performance and generalization capability in reinforcement learning settings with limited action data.",

      "value": "empirical",
      "justification": "The paper presents experimental results and evaluations of the proposed method ALPT on benchmark game-playing environments.",
      "quote": "Through various experiments and ablations, we demonstrate that leveraging the generalization capabilities of IDMs is critical to the success of ALPT, as opposed to, for example, pretraining the DT model alone on the multi-environment datasets or training the IDM only on the target environment. On a benchmark game-playing environment, we show that ALPT yields as much as 5x improvement in performance."
