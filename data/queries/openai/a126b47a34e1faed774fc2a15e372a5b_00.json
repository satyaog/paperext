    "description": "The paper investigates how neural activity, which resides on low-dimensional manifolds, adapts in response to perturbations in neural-interface tasks using a simplified Gaussian model. It specifically differentiates between adaptation within manifolds (WM) and outside manifolds (OM). The study aims to demonstrate that gradient-descent learning can explain the varied adaptation speeds for WM and OM perturbations.",
