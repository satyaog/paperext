    "description": "The paper proposes a learning-based framework to optimize handover parameters in cellular networks, addressing the complex dependencies between neighboring cells and jointly optimizing the entire network. The framework makes use of a novel auto-grouping GCN approach and introduces local multi-objective optimization strategies. The efficacy of the framework is validated using a simulator constructed with real network data.",
