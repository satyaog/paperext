    "description": "The paper investigates the possibility of Lorentz invariance violation as a potential explanation for the recent tension observed in long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments, specifically T2K and NOvA. The study explores both isotropic and non-isotropic Lorentz invariance violations in dimensions D = 4, 5, and 6, and examines their effects on neutrino oscillation data and the anomalous muon magnetic moment.",
