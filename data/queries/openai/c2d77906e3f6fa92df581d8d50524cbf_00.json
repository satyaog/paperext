    "description": "The paper introduces InfoShield, a method that employs information theory to identify micro-clusters of near-duplicate documents, which can signal human trafficking. It extends the method to DeltaShield for incremental updates. The approach is scalable, parameter-free, interpretable, and generalizable, providing high precision and interpretability, especially in the anti-human trafficking domain.",
