    "description": "This paper introduces GROOD, a novel method for Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection that leverages gradient information in combination with distance metrics to detect OOD samples in deep neural networks. The method creates a gradient space that distinguishes between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples, utilizing class prototypes and a targeted mix-up operation on early layers of the network. GROOD shows state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets, such as ImageNet-1K, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.",

Notably, when benchmarked on ImageNet-1k, GROOD surpasses the established robustness of state-of-the-art baselines."
