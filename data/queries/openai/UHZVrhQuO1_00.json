    "description": "The paper explores the connection between Finite Time Lyapunov Exponents (FTLEs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), particularly focusing on how FTLEs relate to RNN gradient subspaces and input sensitivity. The research provides a novel expression for RNN gradients using FTLE components and demonstrates the impact of dynamical systems' stability on RNN computations.",
