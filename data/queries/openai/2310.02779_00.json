    "description": "This paper introduces Expected Flow Networks (EFlowNets), an extension of Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to stochastic environments and two-player adversarial games. The proposed method is evaluated in tasks like protein design and Connect-4, demonstrating superior performance over previous formulations of GFlowNets.",
    "type": {
      "value": "empirical",
      "justification": "The paper conducts experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed model in various tasks, indicating an empirical study.",
      "quote": "We show that EFlowNets outperform other GFlowNet formulations in stochastic tasks such as protein design. We then extend the concept of EFlowNets to adversarial environments, proposing adversarial flow networks (AFlowNets) for two-player zero-sum games. We show that AFlowNets learn to find above 80% of optimal moves in Connect-4 via self-play and outperform AlphaZero in tournaments."
