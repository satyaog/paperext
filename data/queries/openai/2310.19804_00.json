    "description": "The paper explores a new perspective on behavioural metrics for Markov decision processes (MDPs) by employing positive definite kernels. This new approach helps in defining a new metric that is equivalent to the MICo distance and contributes to new theoretical findings such as bounding value function differences and embedding the metric into a finite-dimensional Euclidean space.",

      "value": "Theoretical",
      "justification": "The primary contributions of the paper are new theoretical results and perspectives on existing MDP metrics.",
      "quote": "We leverage this new perspective to define a new metric that is provably equivalent to the recently introduced MICo distance (Castro et al., 2021). The kernel perspective further enables us to provide new theoretical results, which has so far eluded prior work."
