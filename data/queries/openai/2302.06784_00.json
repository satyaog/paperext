    "description": "This paper postulates that human-like generations are characterized by stable entropy and proposes the Stable Entropy Hypothesis (SEH). It introduces an entropy-aware decoding algorithm that respects these entropy bounds to enhance the contextual appropriateness, quality, and coherence of open-ended text generation. Through extensive experiments, the study validates the SEH and illustrates that entropy-aware decoding reduces degeneration issues while maintaining high generation quality.",

On two tasks: text completion and dialogue generation, we show that entropy-aware decoding results in a less degenerate, more contextually appropriate, and human-like generation."
