    "description": "This paper presents the Efficient Multitask Affinity Learning Network (EMA-Net), a framework designed to enhance the task refinement capabilities of multitask networks using the novel Cross-Task Affinity Learning (CTAL) module. The paper demonstrates that EMA-Net can adeptly capture local, global, and cross-task interactions using fewer model parameters without significant information loss. State-of-the-art multitask learning performance is achieved on CNN-based models, and the code is publicly available for further research.",
