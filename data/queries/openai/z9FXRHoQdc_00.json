    "description": "This paper introduces the Best Response Shaping (BRS) method aimed at improving cooperation and social welfare in multi-agent reinforcement learning environments. By focusing on reciprocity-based cooperation, the proposed method trains agents to condition their policies on an opponent's policy using a state-aware differentiable conditioning mechanism.",
