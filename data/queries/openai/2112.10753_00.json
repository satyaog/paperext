    "description": "This paper investigates system identification for autonomous Markov jump linear systems (MJS) with complete state observations. It introduces the switched least squares method, proves its strong consistency, and provides data-dependent and data-independent rates of convergence. The results indicate that the proposed method has convergence rates similar to those of non-switched linear systems.",
