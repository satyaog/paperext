    "description": "This paper introduces MasakhaPOS, a part-of-speech (POS) dataset covering 20 African languages. The study explores challenges in POS annotation for these languages using the UD guidelines and evaluates baseline POS tagging models, including conditional random fields and multilingual pretrained language models. The paper emphasizes the effectiveness of selecting the appropriate transfer language for enhancing POS tagging performance in low-resource languages.",

Furthermore, we experimented with different parameter-efficient cross-lingual transfer methods (Pfeiffer et al., 2021; Ansell et al., 2022), and transfer languages with available training data in the UD."
