    "description": "This paper introduces FAENet, a flexible framework utilizing stochastic frame-averaging to make any model E(3)-equivariant or invariant through data transformations. FAENet is a simple, fast, and expressive Graph Neural Network (GNN) designed for materials modeling without symmetry-preserving architectural constraints. The paper evaluates its accuracy and computational scalability on materials modeling datasets such as OC20 and QM9.",
