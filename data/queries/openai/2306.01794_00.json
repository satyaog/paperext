    "description": "The paper introduces DiffPack, a torsional diffusion model for predicting protein side-chain conformations by autoregressively generating torsional angles and training separate diffusion models for each angle. The method demonstrates improved accuracy on benchmarks like CASP13 and CASP14 compared to existing methods, including enhancements to AlphaFold2 predictions.",
