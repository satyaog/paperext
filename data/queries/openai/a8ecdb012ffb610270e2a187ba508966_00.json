    "description": "This paper investigates the role of sensory salience processing (SSP) in modulating visual attention towards faces in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using baseline eye-tracking data from the EU-AIMS Longitudinal European Autism Project (LEAP). It specifically examines the possible impact of LC-NE (locus coeruleus-norepinephrine) system functioning on SSP and its association with social attention in ASD.",
