    "description": "We propose a new first-order optimization algorithm — AcceleratedGradient-OptimisticGradient (AG-OG) Descent Ascent—for separable convex-concave minimax optimization. The main idea of our algorithm is to carefully leverage the structure of the minimax problem, performing Nesterov acceleration on the individual component and optimistic gradient on the coupling component.",
