    "description": "This paper studies unsupervised approaches to improve audio-text cross-modal representations using unpaired text and audio. It explores domain-unspecific and domain-specific methods to curate audio-text pairs for training and demonstrates significant improvements in zero-shot classification performance for sound event and acoustic scene classification tasks.",

We also show that when domain-specific curation is used in conjunction with a soft-labeled contrastive loss, we are able to obtain significant improvement in terms of zero-shot classification performance on downstream sound event classification or acoustic scene classification tasks."
