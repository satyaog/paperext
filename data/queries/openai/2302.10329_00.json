    "description": "This paper explores the concept of increasing agency in machine learning (ML) systems and the associated potential harms. The authors attempt to identify and discuss systemic and delayed impacts, disempowerment effects, and emergent risks from such agentic systems, particularly on marginalized groups. It also examines sociotechnical attributes and suggests regulatory and institutional interventions to mitigate these harms.",

      "value": "Theoretical",
      "justification": "The paper primarily discusses theoretical concepts related to agency in algorithmic systems, identifies potential harms, and suggests ways to anticipate and mitigate these harms rather than conducting empirical experiments.",
      "quote": "Rather, we use the term agency to highlight the increasingly evident fact that ML systems are not fully under human control. Our work explores increasingly agentic algorithmic systems in three parts. First, we explain the notion of an increase in agency for algorithmic systems in the context of diverse perspectives on agency across disciplines. Second, we argue for the need to anticipate harms from increasingly agentic systems. Third, we discuss important harms from increasingly agentic systems and ways forward for addressing them."
