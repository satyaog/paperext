    "description": "The paper introduces 'broken neural scaling laws' (BNSL), a functional form that better predicts and extrapolates the scaling behavior of deep neural networks across a variety of architectures and tasks. The authors assert that BNSL can model non-monotonic behaviors and inflection points, providing more accurate scaling predictions compared to previous models.",
