    "description": "This paper introduces MUDiff, a novel model that generates a comprehensive representation of molecules by jointly learning 2D discrete molecule structures and 3D continuous molecule coordinates using diffusion processes. The study also proposes MUformer, a graph transformer designed to denoise the diffusion process while adhering to 3D roto-translation equivariance constraints.",
