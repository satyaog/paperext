    "description": "This paper investigates Bayesian inference in probabilistic models with uncertain evidence. It evaluates different methods, including 'distributional evidence,' Jeffrey's rule, and virtual evidence, to provide insights into their consistency and applicability in such scenarios. The paper includes experiments to showcase different interpretations of uncertain evidence and their impact on latent variable inference.",
