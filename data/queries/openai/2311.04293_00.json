    "description": "This paper explores the integration of Lie point symmetries into Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to improve the efficiency and generalization capabilities of neural solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs). The authors propose a novel loss function that includes symmetry information and demonstrate, through empirical evaluations, that this approach significantly enhances the sample efficiency of PINNs.",
