    "description": "The paper introduces GRAPH TEXT, a novel framework designed to convert graph data to natural language format to facilitate reasoning via Large Language Models (LLMs). GRAPH TEXT constructs a graph-syntax tree for each graph capturing node attributes and inter-node relationships. By transforming graph tasks into text generation tasks, GRAPH TEXT enables training-free and interactive graph reasoning.",
