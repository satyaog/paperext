    "description": "This paper addresses the load balancing problem in cellular networks caused by User Equipment (UE) handoff between Base Stations (BSs). It formulates the problem as a Markov game and proposes the Robust Multi-agent Attention Actor-Critic (Robust-MA3C) algorithm. This algorithm leverages collaboration among BSs using self-attention mechanisms and introduces a nature agent to model system uncertainty and achieve Nash equilibrium policies. The proposed method is evaluated through extensive simulations demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art multi-agent reinforcement learning methods.",
