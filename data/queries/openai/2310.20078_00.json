    "description": "The paper proposes a novel fuzzing framework called TorchProbe designed for dynamic deep learning compilers. Through several code transformations, it generates test cases that include dynamic features such as control flows, in-place tensor mutation, list comprehension, and nested functions. The paper reports the identification of twenty previously unknown bugs in the PyTorch compiler and its underlying tensor compiler Triton.",
