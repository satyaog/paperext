    "description": "This paper introduces a novel multitask learning framework in reinforcement learning (RL), where multiple specialized pathways through a single neural network are trained simultaneously. Each pathway focuses on a specific task. The proposed method achieves competitive performance with existing multitask RL methods while using a significantly smaller number of neurons per task. The approach is demonstrated on several continuous control tasks in both online and offline settings.",
