    "description": "This paper presents a novel method for exploring variations among a set of input 3D shapes using a 2D exploration space. The method constructs a mapping to a sub-space of a pre-trained generative model's latent space that optimizes the smoothness of interpolations. This allows for transferring these variations to high-quality meshes while avoiding detail loss from the generator's unstructured output.",
