    "description": "The paper focuses on value function estimation in continual reinforcement learning. It proposes decomposing the value function into two components updated at different timescales: a permanent value function (learning general knowledge) and a transient value function (for quick adaptation). Empirical studies show the approach improves performance on prediction and control tasks.",
