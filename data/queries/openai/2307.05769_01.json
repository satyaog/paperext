    "description": "This paper presents a scalable solution with adjustable computation time for the joint problem of scheduling and assigning machines and transporters for missions that must be completed in a fixed order of operations across multiple stages. The work aims to minimize both the required time and energy consumed by the transporters, using an integer linear programming solver within a sliding time window.",
