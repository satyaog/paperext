    "description": "This paper revisits the ad-hoc teamplay challenge in the cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) setting using the game Hanabi. The authors propose a new framework to evaluate few-shot coordination (FSC) by defining an adaptation regret metric to measure the adaptability of MARL methods. They conduct experiments with several state-of-the-art MARL algorithms, analyze their adaptability, and study the influence of different hyper-parameters on adaptability.",
