    "description": "This paper introduces Presto, a lightweight pre-trained Transformer model designed for remote sensing tasks by specifically processing remote sensing pixel-timeseries data. The model excels in computational efficiency and flexibility with diverse input formats, requiring fewer parameters and computation for predictive accuracy, making it suitable for large-scale remote sensing deployments.",
