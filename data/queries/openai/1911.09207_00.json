    "description": "This paper examines the application of game theory to kidney exchange programs (KEPs). It focuses on modeling KEPs as non-cooperative games to understand the behavior of different entities involved, such as hospitals or regions. The paper generalizes existing two-player models to N-player scenarios and evaluates the impact of quality information on game outcomes. The analysis includes computational experiments using data from the Canada Kidney Paired Donation Program.",
