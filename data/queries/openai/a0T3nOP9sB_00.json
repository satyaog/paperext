    "description": "This paper investigates how deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents adaptively solve the patch foraging problem, which is a key behavioral optimization challenge studied in biology. It aims to understand whether agents can learn optimal foraging strategies akin to biological ones and if their internal dynamics reflect those of non-human primates. The study demonstrates that RL agents are capable of learning adaptive foraging strategies, achieve near-optimal foraging performance considering temporal discounting, and exhibit internal dynamics similar to neural recordings from foraging primates.",
