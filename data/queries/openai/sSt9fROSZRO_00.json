    "description": "The paper explores the potential of multi-task pretraining to improve generalization in deep reinforcement learning. It evaluates the effectiveness of pretraining an agent on multiple variants of Atari 2600 games before fine-tuning on unseen variants. The study uses the IMPALA algorithm for pretraining and features experiments with different network capacities to understand their impact on generalization.",
