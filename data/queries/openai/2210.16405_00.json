    "description": "This paper discusses the evaluation of generative models specifically targeting categorical data. It suggests an alternative evaluation metric involving a synthetic setting, which aims to rank generative models more reliably than traditional log-likelihood methods, by binning the space at different granularity levels and applying statistical tests.",
    "type": {
      "value": "Empirical Study",
      "justification": "The paper presents experiments with synthetic data to evaluate different categorical generative models and validate the proposed evaluation method.",
      "quote": "We validate our binning procedure through synthetic experiments, ensuring it can preserve the correct ranking of synthetic generative models. We then show that our testing procedure correctly ranks state-of-the-art generative models trained on our synthetic task by comparing with the empirical total variation on the initial space Ω and with visual inspection of the learned distributions."
