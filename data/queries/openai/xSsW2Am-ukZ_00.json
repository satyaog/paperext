    "description": "This paper investigates the principles underlying iterative magnitude pruning (IMP), an algorithm used to find highly sparse and trainable subnetworks, through the lens of error landscape geometry. The authors aim to understand the mechanisms that allow IMP to identify 'winning tickets' and how these subnetworks can be trained to achieve the same accuracy as the full network.",
