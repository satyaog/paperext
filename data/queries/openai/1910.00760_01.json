    "description": "The paper proposes a new family of efficient and expressive deep generative models for graphs, called Graph Recurrent Attention Networks (GRANs). The model generates graphs by creating blocks of nodes and associated edges at each step, using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with attention to better capture dependencies in the graph structure. The model is evaluated on several benchmark datasets, showing state-of-the-art performance in terms of both efficiency and sample quality.",
