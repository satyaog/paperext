    "description": "The paper presents Timely Generative Pre-trained Transformer (TimelyGPT), which employs an extrapolatable position (xPos) embedding, recurrent attention and temporal convolution modules for handling ultra-long time-series forecasting tasks. The model is particularly effective in healthcare scenarios, including patient monitoring using biosignals and electronic health records (EHRs).",
