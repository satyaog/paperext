    "description": "The paper introduces GAUCHE, an open-source library designed for applying Gaussian processes to chemistry problems. It is particularly useful in low-data regimes and focuses on applications such as molecular discovery, reaction optimization, and protein design. GAUCHE offers a range of GPU-accelerated kernels designed to handle molecular representations like graphs, strings, and bit vectors. The library interfaces with GPyTorch and BoTorch and aims to make probabilistic modeling and black-box optimization techniques accessible to chemists and materials scientists.",
