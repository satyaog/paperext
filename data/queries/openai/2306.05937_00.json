    "description": "The paper introduces a distributionally robust contextual optimization model aimed at maximizing the coefficient of prescriptiveness, a measure that compares the quality of contextual decisions against a reference decision. The model incorporates side information and addresses distribution shifts. Additionally, a bisection algorithm for solving the model is presented and evaluated through numerical experiments on a contextual shortest path problem.",
