    "description": "The paper presents EvalGen, a mixed-initiative approach to aligning LLM-generated evaluation functions with human preferences. EvalGen assists users in generating evaluation criteria and implementing assertions, aiming for the evaluation functions to reflect user preferences. A qualitative study with industry practitioners explored the tool's effectiveness, and the paper draws implications for future design of LLM evaluation assistants.",
