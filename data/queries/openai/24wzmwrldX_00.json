    "description": "The paper introduces a framework for automatically defining and learning deep generative models with problem-specific structure. The approach involves training diffusion models with architectures tailored to the problem specification, leveraging graphical models to describe relationships between variables. The paper demonstrates improved performance across several tasks, such as sorting and matrix factorization, using this framework.",
