    "description": "This paper identifies the 'dormant neuron phenomenon' in deep reinforcement learning, where an increasing number of inactive neurons negatively impacts network expressivity. The authors propose a solution called ReDo (Recycling Dormant neurons) to maintain network expressivity and improve performance. The paper demonstrates the presence of this phenomenon across various algorithms and environments, and showcases the effectiveness of ReDo in mitigating its adverse effects.",
