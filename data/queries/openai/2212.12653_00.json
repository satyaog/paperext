    "description": "The paper proposes an efficient framework for ternary quantization called Hyperspherical Quantization (HQ), to produce smaller and more accurate compressed models. It integrates hyperspherical learning, pruning, and reinitialization to reduce the cosine distance between full-precision and ternary weights.",

Compared with existing work at similar compression levels (∼30×, ∼40×), our method significantly improves the test accuracy and reduces the model size."
