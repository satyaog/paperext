    "description": "The paper introduces and formalizes a relaxed form of representation identifiability called quantized factor identifiability. It proves the identifiability of quantized latent factors under a generic nonlinear diffeomorphism and presents a comprehensive proof of the recovery of these factors, assuming independent discontinuities in their density.",

      "quote": "However, in the present theoretical work, we revisit and tackle the problem of fully unsupervised identifiability of latent factors, the most challenging setting. ... We introduce and formalize a novel relaxed form of representation identifiability: quantized factor identifiability."
