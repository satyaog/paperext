    "description": "This paper introduces a novel approach to task and motion planning (TAMP) called Stein Task and Motion Planning (STAMP). The method converts discrete-and-continuous TAMP problems into inference problems on a continuous domain, solving them using Stein Variational Gradient Descent from a parallelized differentiable physics simulator. The approach aims to find multiple diverse plans efficiently in a single optimization run. The paper demonstrates the efficacy of this method on two TAMP problems and benchmarks it against existing TAMP baselines.",
