    "description": "This paper introduces a new data generator called PySCFIPU, which utilizes Intelligence Processing Units (IPUs) to create a large quantum chemistry dataset called QM1B. The dataset consists of one billion training examples, aiming to overcome the limitations of previous DFT datasets. The paper validates the dataset's effectiveness by training a baseline neural network model (SchNet), showing performance improvements with increased training data.",

      "quote": "In this paper, we take a first step towards utilising hardware accelerators by introducing the data generator PySCFIPU using Intelligence Processing Units (IPUs). This allowed us to create the dataset QM1B with one billion training examples containing 9-11 heavy atoms. We demonstrate that a simple baseline neural network (SchNet 9M) improves its performance by simply increasing the amount of training data without additional inductive biases."
