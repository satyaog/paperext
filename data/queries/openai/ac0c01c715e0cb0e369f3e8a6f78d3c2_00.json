    "description": "The paper proposes DiffPreT, a novel pre-training approach for protein encoders by modeling the joint distribution of protein sequences and structures using denoising diffusion models. This method integrates joint diffusion trajectories to capture inter-atomic interactions and residue type dependencies. The research further introduces SiamDiff, an enhanced version of DiffPreT, which captures conformational variations by maximizing mutual information between representations of diffusion trajectories of correlated conformers. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of both methods on various protein understanding tasks.",
