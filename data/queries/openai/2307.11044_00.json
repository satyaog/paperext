    "description": "The paper explores convergence in reinforcement learning, particularly focusing on bounded agents. It proposes two complementary accounts of agent convergence centered around an agent's behavior and performance. The first perspective looks at the minimal number of states needed to describe the agent’s future behavior, while the second views convergence as changes in performance only occurring when the agent's internal state changes. The paper establishes properties of these definitions, and their relationships, and discusses implications for agent design and analysis.",

We establish basic properties of these two definitions, show that they accommodate typical views of convergence in standard settings, and prove several facts about their nature and relationship."

Our first account roughly says that an agent’s behavior has converged in an environment when the minimum number of states needed to produce the agent’s future behavior can no longer decrease. The second account roughly says that an agent’s performance has converged in an environment when the agent’s performance can only change if the agent’s internal state changes."
