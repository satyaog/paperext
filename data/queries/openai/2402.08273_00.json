    "description": "The paper introduces a novel path perturbation technique for Metropolis Light Transport (MLT) that adaptively updates state-dependent parameters of the proposal distribution, based on the history of the Markov chain. The approach partitions the path space along a few dimensions, resulting in low-dimensional canonical spaces associated with adaptive parameters, refined through an adaptive quadtree structure. The method aims to improve rendering efficiency in photorealistic image generation by reducing correlation in the Markov chain.",
