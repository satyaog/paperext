    "description": "This paper introduces a novel Signed Laplacian Graph Neural Network (SLGNN) for signed graph representation learning. The proposed model leverages low-pass and high-pass graph convolution filters derived from spectral graph theory to separately process positive and negative links within signed graphs. Additionally, a self-gating mechanism is implemented to adjust the impact of low- and high-frequency information within the message passing framework. The model aims to address the balance and differentiation between positive and negative links, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world signed graph datasets.",
