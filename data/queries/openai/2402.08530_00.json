    "description": "This paper presents a new method for distributional reinforcement learning (DRL) that separates the transition structure and reward in the learning process. The method introduces the Distributional Successor Measure (DSM), which describes the distributional consequences of behavior. The paper provides theoretical connections between DSM and distributional/model-based RL, and proposes an algorithm for learning DSM from data using a two-level maximum mean discrepancy approach. It also presents an application in zero-shot risk-sensitive policy evaluation.",
