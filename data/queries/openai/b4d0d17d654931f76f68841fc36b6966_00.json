    "description": "The paper investigates how exogenous (involuntary) and endogenous (voluntary) attention affect perceptual facilitation during visual processing. The study uses spatial cueing of visuospatial attention, electroencephalography (EEG), and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to uncover differential and similar neural processes of both attention types at various times after stimuli. The paper links these processes to perception by examining behavioral effects using mediation analyses with single-trial event-related potentials.",

      "quote": "In the current work, we investigated the differential and overlapping effects of exogenous and endogenous attention on visual processing. We combined spatial cueing of visuospatial attention, electroencephalography (EEG), and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to examine where and when the effects of exogenous and endogenous attention were maximally different and maximally similar."
