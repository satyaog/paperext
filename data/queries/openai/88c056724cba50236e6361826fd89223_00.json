    "description": "The study proposes an interpretable deep learning method called multi-omic embedded topic model (moETM) for integrative analysis of single-cell multimodal data. The method uses a product-of-experts for variational inference and multiple linear decoders to learn multi-omic signatures. moETM demonstrates superior performance compared to six state-of-the-art methods on seven public datasets and reveals insights into immune signatures.",
