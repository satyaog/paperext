    "description": "This research introduces a game-theoretic model, the Critical Node Game (CNG), which assesses the cyber-security risk of cloud networks. It aims to guide security experts in developing optimal security strategies by combining game theory, combinatorial optimization, and cyber-security. The CNG is a simultaneous and non-cooperative game where a defender and an attacker each solve a combinatorial optimization problem. The paper provides an algorithm to compute stable solutions for this game and demonstrates its effectiveness through computational tests on real-world cloud networks.",
