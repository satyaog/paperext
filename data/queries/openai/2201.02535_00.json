    "description": "This paper proposes a new heuristic pricing algorithm based on machine learning to accelerate the pricing problem (PP) part of the column generation (CG) method used in constrained shortest path problems (CSPPs). By leveraging data from previous executions, the objective is to reduce the size of the network by retaining only arcs with a high chance of being part of the solution, thus improving computational efficiency. The approach is demonstrated on the vehicle and crew scheduling problem (VCSP) and the vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW), showing significant computational time reductions.",

      "quote": "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is devoted to some preliminaries and details about CG and the dynamic programming method used to solve the SPPRC. In Section 3, we describe the proposed selection strategy. Sections 4 and 5 will cover our two case studies, the VCSP and VRPTW respectively, highlighting the implementation differences between the two problems and reporting the computational results for each of them."
