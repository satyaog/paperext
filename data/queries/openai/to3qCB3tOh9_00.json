    "description": "The paper introduces a novel approach to protein representation learning by pretraining on 3D geometric structures of proteins. This method leverages multiview contrastive learning and self-prediction tasks to pretrain a protein graph encoder, which is effective for various downstream tasks such as function prediction and fold classification. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art sequence-based methods while using significantly less pretraining data.",
