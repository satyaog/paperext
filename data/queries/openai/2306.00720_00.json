    "description": "This paper explores the combination of metaheuristics and neural network solvers for the Transit Network Design Problem (NDP). Specifically, it proposes a hybrid algorithm that integrates a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model into a Bee Colony Optimization (BCO) metaheuristic, demonstrating significant performance improvements over both the stand-alone learned policy and the original BCO algorithm.",

      "value": "Empirical Study",

      "quote": "Our experimental results demonstrate that this hybrid algorithm outperforms the learned policy alone by up to 20% and the original BCO algorithm by up to 53% on realistic problem instances. We perform a set of ablations to study the impact of each component of the modified algorithm."
