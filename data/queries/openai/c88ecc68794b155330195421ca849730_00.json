It explores the impact of class imbalance through experiments with simulated and real brain data and provides practical recommendations for addressing data imbalance issues in neuroscience.",

Importantly, we present a list of recommendations for dealing with imbalanced data, as well as open-source code to allow the neuroscience community to replicate and extend our observations and explore alternative approaches to coping with imbalanced data."
