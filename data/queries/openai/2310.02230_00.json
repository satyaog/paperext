    "description": "The paper addresses the issue of shortcut learning in deep neural networks, where models rely on spurious correlations in the data. The authors propose using Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) to generate synthetic counterfactuals for ensemble diversification. These models can disentangle features even when trained on fully correlated datasets, making them suitable for overcoming simplicity biases without the need for additional out-of-distribution data. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated using two datasets, ColorDSprites and UTKFace.",
