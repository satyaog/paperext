    "description": "This paper addresses latent variables identification and out-of-support image generation in representation learning by introducing a class of decoders termed additive decoders. The researchers demonstrate that such decoders can identify blocks of latent variables up to permutation and block-wise invertible transformations under reconstruction problem conditions. They also exhibit the capability of cartesian-product extrapolation, providing conditions for nonlinear ICA and advancements in OCRL methodologies.",
