    "description": "This paper introduces the Score-based Likelihood Characterization (SLIC) framework for resolving the difficulty of likelihood analysis in the presence of non-Gaussian noise by using a data-driven noise model. The method uses diffusion generative models to estimate the gradient of the probability density of noise and employs Langevin sampling for unbiased likelihood analysis. The effectiveness of SLIC is demonstrated using real data from the Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope.",
