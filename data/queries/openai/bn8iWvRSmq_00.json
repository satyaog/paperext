    "description": "The paper introduces a novel framework named SF-GEN leveraging successor features (SFs) for controlled text generation, aiming to decouple the language model's dynamics from task-specific objectives. The method proves memory-efficient, computationally effective, and flexible in dynamically integrating multiple target subjects without altering the language model's parameters. Evaluations demonstrate its efficacy in sentiment control and detoxification tasks, outperforming baseline models while maintaining superior text quality.",
