    "description": "This paper investigates if it is possible to predict the relaxed energy of systems in the OC20 dataset while ignoring the relative position of the adsorbate to the catalyst. The study leverages ML models such as SchNet, DimeNet++, and FAENet, applying modifications to measure the impact on model performance.",

      "quote": "To achieve this, we propose four modifications of existing GNN architectures, collectively referred to as Disconnected GNNs. All four modifications enable the base architecture to make relaxed energy predictions without explicitly modeling geometric interactions between the adsorbate and the catalyst. We then evaluate the trade-off of omitting these interactions through experiments on the OC20 dataset and suggest future directions to overcome the limits associated with the input adslab configuration."
