    "description": "This paper investigates the neural responses to dynamic narratives in movies using natural language processing and hidden Markov models. By analyzing over 50,000 brain images of participants watching the movie Forrest Gump, the study identifies distinct brain states related to the semantic aspects of the narrative. It particularly emphasizes the role of the default network in semantic information integration.",

By analyzing over 50,000 brain images of participants watching Forrest Gump from the studyforrest dataset, we find distinct brain states that capture unique semantic aspects of the unfolding story."

NLP here now offers the potential of disclosing complex aspects of semantic structure in the movie material. Therefore, the strategy of porting tools from NLP to imaging neuroscience may allow to more cleanly disentangle semantically denotable higher-order brain functions in humans against the brain’s housekeeping signals and background noise."
