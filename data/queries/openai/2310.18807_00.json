    "description": "This paper introduces an object-centric compositional neural module network (OC-NMN) designed for visual generative reasoning tasks. The model decomposes tasks into a series of primitives applied to objects using modularity. This approach aims to improve out-of-distribution generalization by leveraging neural templates composed of neural modules. The proposed method is evaluated using a new benchmark, Arith-MNIST, which involves arithmetic operations on visual digits.",
