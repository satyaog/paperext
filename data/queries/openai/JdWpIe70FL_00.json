    "description": "This paper introduces Pairwise-Distance Estimators (PaiDEs), a novel approach for epistemic uncertainty estimation in ensembles of deep learning models. The method estimates uncertainty using the pairwise distance between model components to establish entropy bounds without relying on sample-based Monte Carlo estimators. It demonstrates higher efficiency and accuracy, especially in high-dimensional settings. The paper validates the approach through a series of experiments on synthetic data and multi-dimensional robotic environments.",
