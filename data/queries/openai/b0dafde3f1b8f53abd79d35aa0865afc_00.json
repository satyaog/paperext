    "description": "The paper proposes a new probabilistic approach to attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) for the classification of whole slide images (WSI) in medical diagnosis. The new method, called Bayes-MIL, introduces uncertainty measures at the patch level to improve the interpretability and accuracy of the model.",

      "justification": "The paper presents new experimental results on large-scale WSI datasets to show the effectiveness of the proposed Bayes-MIL method, alongside discussions and visualizations of these results.",
      "quote": "Experimental results show Bayes-MIL outperforms the related methods in patch-level and slide-level metrics and provides much better interpretable ROI on several large-scale WSI datasets."
