    "description": "This paper presents a comprehensive study on using deep reinforcement learning (RL) to create dynamic locomotion controllers for bipedal robots. The study introduces a dual-history RL framework that incorporates both long-term and short-term I/O history of the robot, enabling it to adapt to a variety of dynamic skills, such as walking, running, and jumping. The resulting controllers can generalize well to new environments and exhibit robust behaviors to unexpected scenarios. Extensive real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of these RL-based controllers under diverse tasks and perturbations.",
