    "description": "This paper addresses the challenge of unsupervised time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) with noisy training data. It proposes a novel approach called TSAD-C, which consists of three modules: a Decontaminator, a Long-range Variable Dependency Modeling module, and an Anomaly Scoring module. TSAD-C is designed to handle contaminated data where anomalies are present in the training set. Extensive experiments on three physiological datasets demonstrate that TSAD-C outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art performance.",
