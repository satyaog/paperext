Their proposed method, which they named as Puzzle-AE, trains a U-Net autoencoder to reconstruct the puzzled input. The reconstruction objective ensures that the model is sensitive to the pixel-level anomalies, while the pretext task of solving the puzzle enables the network to capture high-level semantic information, as shown in Fig. 2. They further boosted the performance of their model by incorporating adversarial training."
