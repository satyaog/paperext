    "description": "This paper presents a multi-modal molecule structure-text model named MoleculeSTM, aimed at joint learning of molecular chemical structures and textual descriptions using contrastive learning. The model is trained on a large dataset called PubChemSTM with over 280,000 structure-text pairs. The paper emphasizes the model's ability for text-based molecule retrieval and editing, demonstrating superior zero-shot generalization capabilities to novel biochemical concepts.",
