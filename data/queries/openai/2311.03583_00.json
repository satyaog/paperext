    "description": "This paper investigates an extremal graph theory problem to find graphs with a given size that maximize the number of edges without having 3- or 4-cycles. The study formulates this as a sequential decision-making problem and compares AlphaZero, a neural-network guided tree search, with tabu search, a heuristic local search method.",
