    "description": "This paper investigates the approximate minimization problem of Weighted Finite Automata (WFA), specifically to compute the best possible approximation of a WFA given a bound on the number of states. By reformulating the problem in terms of Hankel matrices and leveraging Adamyan-Arov-Krein (AAK) theory, the paper provides a theoretical analysis and an algorithm for the optimal spectral-norm approximate minimization of irredundant WFAs with real weights over a one-letter alphabet, with guarantees for computation in polynomial time.",

This allows us to exploit the work of Adamyan, Arov and Krein which has come to be known as AAK theory (Adamyan et al. 1971): a series of results connecting the theory of complex functions to Hankel matrices."
