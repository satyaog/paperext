    "description": "This paper introduces the concept of commonality as a measure for recommender systems in cultural contexts, emphasizing shared cultural experience and diversity. The authors propose this metric to complement existing utility, diversity, and fairness metrics, arguing it better aligns with public service goals like cultural citizenship. The paper includes theoretical foundations, interdisciplinary dialogue, and empirical analysis using movies, music, and literature datasets.",
