    "description": "The paper focuses on addressing the issue of Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by proposing two defense mechanisms: Maximum Entropy GAN (MEGAN) and Mutual Information Minimization GAN (MIMGAN). The authors analyze overfitting in the discriminator and introduce measures to improve privacy while maintaining the quality of generated data.",
