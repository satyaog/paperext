    "description": "This paper presents a taxonomy of sociotechnical harms from algorithmic systems based on a scoping review of 172 computing research articles. The taxonomy aims to help practitioners systematically consider potential harms, organized into five categories: representational, allocative, quality-of-service, interpersonal harms, and societal harms.",

      "value": "Empirical",
      "justification": "The paper is based on a scoping review of 172 computing research articles, which is an empirical method.",
      "quote": "Based on a scoping review of computing research (n=172), we present an applied taxonomy of sociotechnical harms to support a more systematic surfacing of potential harms in algorithmic systems."
