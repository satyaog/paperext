    "description": "This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance stability and knowledge transfer in multi-task hierarchical reinforcement learning using the options framework. The method, inspired by boosting from supervised learning, progressively introduces new options while keeping older ones fixed. This approach improves stability and leverages knowledge transfer through a mechanism called the Option Library.",
