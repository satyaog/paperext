    "description": "The paper investigates the utility of transformer-based world models in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly focusing on whether they improve policy gradients. Traditional model-based approaches to RL often struggle with long-horizon tasks due to inefficient gradient propagation. The authors introduce Actions World Models (AWMs) to address this challenge, demonstrating their empirical effectiveness over long horizons.",
