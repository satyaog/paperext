    "description": "This paper introduces Tree Cross Attention (TCA) and ReTreever, with TCA being a scalable and token-efficient alternative to Cross Attention by organizing data in a tree structure and performing tree-based search during inference. ReTreever, leveraging TCA, shows significant improvements in token efficiency and performance across various tasks compared to established models like Perceiver IO.",
