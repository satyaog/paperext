    "description": "The paper explores different methods to handle inter-rater variability when training deep learning models for medical image segmentation. It compares three label fusion methods using both conventional training frameworks and a specialized framework called SoftSeg to handle soft labels. The study evaluates these methods on two public datasets and emphasizes the importance of producing calibrated outputs that account for inter-rater disagreements.",

      "quote": "Our results, across 10 data splittings on two public datasets (spinal cord gray matter challenge, and multiple sclerosis brain lesion segmentation), indicate that SoftSeg models, regardless of the ground truth fusion method, had better calibration and preservation of the inter-rater rater variability compared with their conventional counterparts without impacting the segmentation performance."

        "quote": "Medical tasks are prone to inter-rater variability due to multiple factors such as image quality, professional experience and training, or guideline clarity. Training deep learning networks with annotations from multiple raters is a common practice that mitigates the model’s bias towards a single expert."
