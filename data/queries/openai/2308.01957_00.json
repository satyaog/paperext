    "description": "The paper presents AstroPhot, a Python-based astronomical image photometry solver that incorporates automatic differentiation and GPU acceleration, powered by the machine learning library PyTorch. The tool fits models for various astronomical entities and optimizes them simultaneously on CPU or GPU across different types of images. It provides a detailed comparison to other popular astronomical image modeling software and demonstrates its unique features.",
