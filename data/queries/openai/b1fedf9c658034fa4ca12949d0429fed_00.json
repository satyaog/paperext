    "description": "This paper investigates the association between distinct whole-brain cell-types and tissue damage patterns in eleven neurodegenerative disorders. The study utilizes data integration from spatial gene expression, structural MRI, and cell deconvolution to create comprehensive maps of cellular abundance and analyze their overlap with brain atrophy patterns in diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",
