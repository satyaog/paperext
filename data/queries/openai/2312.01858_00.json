    "description": "This study examines the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) as knowledge bases by emphasizing the need for precise and implication-aware fact editing. It introduces a new evaluation protocol and the DepEdit dataset to comprehensively assess the editing process's compliance with specificity (surface form) and implication awareness (logical implications through If-Then rules). Extensive experiments utilizing the DepEdit dataset highlight current limitations in knowledge editing methods, specifically their sensitivity to fact surface forms and their limited ability to infer logical implications of edited facts.",
