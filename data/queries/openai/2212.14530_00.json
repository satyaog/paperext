    "description": "The paper proposes an algorithm for planning under model uncertainty in an online meta-reinforcement learning setting. The algorithm meta-learns the structure across tasks and utilizes it to plan in each task. It provides theoretical guarantees on regret and validates the findings empirically.",

      "justification": "The paper provides a theoretical study with mathematical proofs and theoretical guarantees on regret for the proposed algorithm.",
      "quote": "We propose an algorithm to meta-learn the underlying structure across tasks, utilize it to plan in each task, and upper-bound the regret of the planning loss. Our bound suggests that the average regret over tasks decreases as the number of tasks increases and as the tasks are more similar."
