    "description": "This paper proposes an empirical study on Stack Overflow (SO) to understand the challenges practitioners face when deploying Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) systems. By analyzing 357 SO posts, the study identifies DRL deployment as more difficult than other aspects of DRL systems development. The paper further builds a taxonomy of 31 unique challenges across four deployment platforms: server/cloud, mobile/embedded systems, browsers, and game engines.",
