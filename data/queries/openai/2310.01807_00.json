    "description": "This paper explores how discretization in neural networks can be implemented in a neurally plausible manner through the modeling of attractor dynamics, which partition the continuous representation space into basins corresponding to sequences of symbols. It introduces novel training methods and shows that imposing structure in the symbolic space can produce compositionality in the attractor-supported representation space of rich sensory inputs.",
