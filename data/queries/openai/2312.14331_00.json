    "description": "This paper establishes a connection between Generative Flow Networks (GFNs) and maximum entropy reinforcement learning (RL) by constructing an appropriate reward function. This construction allows for the introduction of maximum entropy GFNs that achieve the maximum entropy attainable without constraints on the state space. The paper provides a theoretical foundation and demonstrates the effectiveness of maximum entropy GFNs in enhancing the exploration of intermediate states and achieving better results in a graph-building environment.",
