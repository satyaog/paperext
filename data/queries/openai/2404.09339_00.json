    "description": "This paper explores the integration of tools to aid in the continual learning of large language models (LLMs). It proposes synthetic and realistic benchmarks to evaluate how LLMs adapt to new tasks while retaining knowledge from previous tasks. The results show that while scaling model size alone is insufficient for continual learning, the use of tools combined with replay methods significantly enhances the adaptation and retention capabilities of LLMs.",

It also presents experimental results that demonstrate the impact of different techniques on the performance of LLMs, indicating empirical research.",
      "quote": "To verify this, we develop a synthetic benchmark and follow this by aggregating existing NLP tasks to form a more realistic testing scenario. While we demonstrate scaling model size is not a solution, regardless of tool usage, continual learning techniques can enable tool LLMs to both adapt faster while forgetting less, highlighting their potential as continual learners."
