    "description": "This paper explores empirical methods for online adaptation of predictive models to label shifts while considering the presence of concurrent conditional shifts. It evaluates the performance of such methods on synthetic and realistic datasets for both classification and regression problems. The paper presents improved performance by learning additional hyper-parameters using appropriate validation sets.",
