    "description": "The paper discusses AI trustworthiness assessment, covering a range of topics from datasets' qualification to risk and performance evaluations, and the necessity of incorporating trust as a key design principle rather than an option. Different attributes and methodologies to measure and ensure trust in AI systems are examined.",
