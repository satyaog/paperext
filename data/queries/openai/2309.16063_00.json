    "description": "The paper explores the use of a Neural Ratio Estimator (NRE) to determine the Hubble constant (H0) in the context of time delay cosmography. The authors simulate various astronomical measurements and train the NRE to output the posterior distribution of H0. The NRE's performance is compared to traditional likelihood-based methods, showing similar accuracy and precision while being significantly faster.",
