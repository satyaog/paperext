    "description": "The paper proposes a variation of the traditional Replay Buffer to improve the adaptivity of Deep Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) to local environment changes. The novel variation is called the Local Forgetting (LoFo) replay buffer, which removes the oldest samples in the local neighborhood of the new samples. This method is shown to mitigate interference from stale data and address catastrophic forgetting. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on various domains, including modified versions of Dyna-Q, PlaNet, and DreamerV2 methods.",
