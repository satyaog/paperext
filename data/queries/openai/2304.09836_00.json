    "description": "This paper systematically studies the reliability of proper scoring rules in evaluating multivariate probabilistic forecasts. Through a power analysis, it identifies the conditions where scoring rules reliably detect forecasting errors, referred to as the 'regions of reliability'. The study involves synthetic benchmarks and real-world applications, revealing significant shortcomings of current evaluation practices.",
