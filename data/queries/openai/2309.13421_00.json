    "description": "This paper studies the use of dynamic learning algorithms in kidney exchange programs (KEPs) to improve the efficiency and fairness of kidney transplants. Focusing on the Canadian Kidney Paired Donation Program, it demonstrates that dynamically learning patient-donor weights can lead to better outcomes in terms of number of transplants, waiting times, and fairness across different patient groups.",

However, this conclusion requires that negative weights (penalties) are permitted in transplant selection, in addition to positive weights (rewards)."
