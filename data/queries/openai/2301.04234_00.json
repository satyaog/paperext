    "description": "This paper investigates the characteristics and practices of logging in ML-based applications. It contrasts these practices with those in traditional software applications and highlights the need for more ML-specific logging libraries. The analysis includes quantitative and qualitative studies of logging statements in 110 open-source ML-based projects from GitHub.",
