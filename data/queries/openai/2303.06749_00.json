    "description": "This paper addresses a strategic decision-making problem faced by logistics providers seeking to find facility location decisions that lead to profitable operations. The authors propose a stochastic bilevel formulation and a non-conventional single-level mixed integer linear programming formulation. They perform experimental studies to analyze the impact of model parameters on the solutions.",

      "quote": "This paper offers four main contributions. First, we consider a problem of high practical relevance to LPs in general, and to our industrial partner, Purolator, in particular. We offer a first attempt to address this problem that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been studied before. Second, the problem can be naturally modeled with a stochastic bilevel formulation where shippers make decisions according to a random utility maximization model. Noteworthy are the intrinsic and endogenous uncertainty in the LP’s costs due to imperfect knowledge of the shippers’ reactions and their customers’ characteristics. Third, using a simulation-based model approximation and properties of the associated optimal solutions, we propose a non-conventional single-level mixed-integer linear programming reformulation. Fourth, we report an experimental study where we analyze the impact of model parameters on solutions and computing times."

At a strategic planning level, the LP has imperfect information thereof. Our strategic profit maximization facility location problem has similarities with facility location and pricing problems.
