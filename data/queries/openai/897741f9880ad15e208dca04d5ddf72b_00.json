    "description": "The paper discusses the emerging field of second-person neuroscience to address disorganization in schizophrenia, focusing on interpersonal space and shared mental processes as key areas of interest. It highlights multi-person analysis and hyperscanning technology for studying social interaction in schizophrenia, and outlines new methods to measure interpersonal dysfunction and model disorganized communication.",

      "value": "Empirical Study",
      "justification": "The paper employs empirical methods such as hyperscanning and behavioural quantification to investigate social dysfunction and disorganized communication in schizophrenia.",
      "quote": "In this review, we embrace the emerging field of second-person neuroscience to address disorganization in schizophrenia... we illustrate how these measures can be used in empirical studies by posing disorganization as a problem of interpersonal processing."
