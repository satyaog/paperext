    "description": "This paper explores defensive strategies against multi-armed attack scenarios where adversaries introduce noise into data samples using various methods. It proposes an innovative information-theoretic zero-shot defense approach that aggregates decisions from multiple pre-existing off-the-shelf detectors without the need for training data. Empirical evaluations using popular computer vision datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this defense mechanism against known adversarial attacks.",
