    "description": "This paper argues that bias terms, which are typically included in many popular machine learning models including neural networks, can be disregarded for some image-related tasks such as image classification. The focus is on zero-bias neural networks, which are shown to possess an important property called scalar (multiplication) invariance. This invariance ensures that a network's prediction remains unchanged when the contrast of the input image is altered. The paper extends scalar invariance to more general cases and discusses its implications for robustness and fairness in neural network predictions.",
