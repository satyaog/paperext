    "description": "The paper presents the Minigrid and Miniworld libraries which provide a suite of goal-oriented 2D and 3D environments designed to facilitate research in reinforcement learning. The libraries are built with a minimalistic design to allow for easy customization and rapid development of new environments. The paper discusses the design philosophy, environment details, and their world generation API and showcases the libraries' capabilities through case studies on transfer learning.",
