    "description": "This paper focuses on replicating a study that investigated the security weaknesses of code suggested by GitHub Copilot. By examining the security of Copilot with newer versions and using MITRE's CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses in Python code, the authors evaluate if improvements have been made in reducing vulnerable code suggestions. Their findings show that while there are reductions in vulnerabilities, Copilot still suggests insecure code.",

Our replication examines Copilot’s security weaknesses using newer versions of Copilot and CodeQL (the security analysis framework)."
