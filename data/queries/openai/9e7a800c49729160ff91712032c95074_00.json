    "description": "This paper systematically reviews and conducts a meta-regression analysis to assess the protective effectiveness of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and hybrid immunity (combination of infection and vaccination) against the omicron variant and severe disease. The study examines the magnitude and duration of this protection.",

      "value": "empirical",
      "justification": "The study involves systematic review and meta-regression analyses, which are empirical research methodologies aimed at synthesizing data from multiple studies to estimate effects.",
      "quote": "Methods For this systematic review and meta-regression, we searched for cohort, cross-sectional, and caseâ€“control studies in MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science...We used log-odds random-effects meta-regression to estimate the magnitude of protection at 1-month intervals."
