    "description": "This paper introduces M-TAG, a modular user-code teaching aid developed for the Geant4 simulation toolkit. M-TAG is designed to help users gradually learn Geant4 by providing pre-built modules and allowing for the addition of new geometric components and detector elements without recompiling the code. This tool aids in the design and testing of radiation detectors for medical applications and has been validated through various simulation projects.",
