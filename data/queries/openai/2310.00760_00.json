    "description": "This paper investigates a hybrid approach that combines nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) and model-based reinforcement learning (RL) for autonomous model car navigation in offroad, unstructured terrains without relying on predefined maps. The study enhances the BADGR LSTM-based network by replacing LSTM modules with transformers, improving environment modeling. The proposed method addresses uncertainty using an ensemble of predictive models, dynamic horizon planning, and a nonlinear MPC controller to balance speed and uncertainty.",
