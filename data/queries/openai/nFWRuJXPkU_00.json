    "description": "This paper addresses the issue of confounding in offline reinforcement learning (RL). It proposes a method to exploit confounded offline data in model-based RL to enhance the sample-efficiency of an interactive agent that collects and learns from online, unconfounded data. The method leverages do-calculus to treat model-based RL as a causal inference problem and introduces a generic method for learning a causal transition model that accounts for confounding through a hidden latent variable. The paper demonstrates the method's effectiveness through synthetic experiments.",
