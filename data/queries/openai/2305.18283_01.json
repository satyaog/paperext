    "description": "This paper introduces CommonAccent, a benchmark dataset optimized for accent classification in multiple languages using large acoustic pre-trained models like Wav2Vec 2.0/XLSR and ECAPA-TDNN. The study fine-tunes these models on subsets of the Common Voice dataset, achieving new state-of-the-art results in English accent classification and evaluates the performance across other languages including German, Spanish, and Italian.",
