    "description": "This research presents a model to optimize the placement of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations within a city to maximize EV adoption. By considering user groups and advanced discrete choice models, this model accounts for diverse user preferences and complex substitution patterns. The model incorporates user behavior into a bilevel optimization framework and provides heuristics to solve large instances. Computational results compare the capabilities of the model against an existing model and examine various heuristic methods.",

Section 4 gives the maximum covering reformulation for the bilevel model. Section 5 discusses various heuristic methods for solving large instance sizes of practical interest. Section 6 provides computational results. The first case, we force the solver to use the same solution for both the GF and the MC models. This allows for comparing the spread of EVs around charging stations."
