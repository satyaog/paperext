    "description": "This paper proposes a novel architecture named TransCeption for medical image segmentation. TransCeption integrates multi-scale semantic information from intra-stage and inter-stage perspectives using ResInception Patch Merging (RIPM), Multi-branch Transformer (MB transformer), and Dual Transformer Bridge. The method is evaluated on multi-organ and skin lesion segmentation tasks, achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.",
