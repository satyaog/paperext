    "description": "This paper proposes an autoregressive framework for modeling dynamic networks with dependent edges. By assuming the edges of a network at each time point are independent conditionally on their lagged values, the model facilitates both simulation and maximum likelihood estimation. It also introduces an improved estimator that addresses slow convergence rates of the initial MLEs due to a large number of parameters.",
