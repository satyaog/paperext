    "description": "This study conducts an in-depth analysis of open-source AIOps projects on GitHub to understand their characteristics. It involves identifying a set of AIOps projects, analyzing repository metrics, examining input data, analysis techniques, and goals of the projects, and assessing their quality metrics. Comparisons with traditional machine learning and general-purpose projects are also made to derive insights into the current state and challenges of AIOps practices.",
