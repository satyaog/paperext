    "description": "This paper uses single-nucleus RNA sequencing to profile lesions from human retinas with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and applies a machine-learning pipeline called CATCH to identify activated glial populations, suggesting a mechanism of disease progression similar across various neurodegenerative conditions.",

      "justification": "The paper presents data from experiments including single-nucleus RNA sequencing of human retina samples, computational analyses, and biological validations.",
      "quote": "Here we use single-nucleus RNA sequencing to proﬁle lesions from 11 postmortem human retinas with age-related macular degeneration and 6 control retinas with no history of retinal disease. We create a machine-learning pipeline based on recent advances in data geometry and topology and identify activated glial populations enriched in the early phase of disease."
