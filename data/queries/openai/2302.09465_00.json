    "description": "This paper introduces Stochastic Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets), which extend traditional GFlowNets to environments with stochastic dynamics. By decomposing state transitions into deterministic and stochastic parts, the proposed method isolates environmental stochasticity and learns a dynamics model to capture it. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of Stochastic GFlowNets over standard GFlowNets, MCMC, and RL-based approaches on various benchmarks.",
