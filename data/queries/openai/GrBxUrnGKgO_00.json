    "description": "This paper investigates how safety engineering frameworks, specifically Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA), can be adapted to manage social and ethical risks in machine learning (ML) systems. The study includes interviews with 30 industry practitioners to gather their insights and current practices in social and ethical risk management.",
