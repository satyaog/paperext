    "description": "The paper explores how genome-wide genetic variations affect protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in inbred strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By mapping these interactions, the research aims to define the biochemical mechanisms underlying complex polygenic traits, utilizing a combination of experimental techniques, including Protein-fragment Complementation Assay (PCA) and genome-wide association studies (GWAS), to uncover the influences of genetic and environmental perturbations on PPIs.",
