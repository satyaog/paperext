    "description": "This paper introduces a novel approach to Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection by leveraging the functional trajectories of samples through the layers of a pre-trained multi-layer neural network. The method is designed to identify OOD samples whose trajectories differ statistically from the reference trajectories characterized by the training set. It does not require additional OOD data and demonstrates competitive performance on ImageNet-1k and other OOD datasets.",
