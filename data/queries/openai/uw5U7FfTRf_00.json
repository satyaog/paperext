    "description": "This paper introduces BaDLoss, a backdoor detection method for machine learning models. The method leverages differences in training dynamics to detect backdoor examples within the training set by injecting reference backdoor examples, tracking loss trajectories, and employing a k-nearest neighbors classifier to identify anomalies. The approach is highly effective in detecting novel backdoor attacks and can eliminate vulnerabilities by removing identified backdoor examples before retraining the model.",
