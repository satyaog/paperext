    "description": "The paper introduces E3Bind, an end-to-end equivariant network designed for the flexible blind self-docking of ligands into protein binding pockets. E3Bind uses geometric constraints and local context to iteratively update ligand positions, orientations, and conformations. The model, which draws inspiration from AlphaFold2, outperforms traditional physics-based and recent deep learning methods in efficiency and accuracy for predicting ligand poses.",
