    "description": "This paper introduces the Thinker algorithm, a novel approach in reinforcement learning that enables agents to autonomously interact with a learned world model. The Thinker algorithm allows agents to perform planning by proposing alternative plans to the world model before taking action. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated through experiments in the game of Sokoban and the Atari 2600 benchmark.",
