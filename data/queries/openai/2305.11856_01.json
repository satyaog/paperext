    "description": "This paper introduces an aerial image-based map (AIM) representation that requires minimal annotation and provides rich road context information for multi-agent behavior modeling in autonomous driving. It integrates AIM into a differentiable driving simulator and demonstrates competitive multi-agent trajectory prediction performance compared to high-definition maps.",
