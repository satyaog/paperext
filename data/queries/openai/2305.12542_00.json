    "description": "This paper introduces ToxBuster, a model designed to detect toxicity in online gaming chat. The model is trained on a dataset of annotated game chat lines from games like Rainbow Six Siege and For Honor. ToxBuster leverages BERT for improved detection accuracy and is evaluated against existing state-of-the-art methods, showing significant improvements in precision and recall.",
