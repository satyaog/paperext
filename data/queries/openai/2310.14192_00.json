    "description": "This paper proposes PromptMix, a two-step method aimed at generating challenging text augmentations near class boundaries and relabeling them to enhance label correctness. The method is used to facilitate the transfer of knowledge from large language models to smaller classifiers in few-shot or zero-shot text classification tasks.",

Our experiments show that generating and, crucially, relabeling borderline examples facilitates the transfer of knowledge of a massive LLM like GPT3.5-turbo into smaller and cheaper classifiers like DistilBERTbase and BERTbase."
