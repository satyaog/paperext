    "description": "The paper introduces a spatial locality prior (SLP) to enhance object-centric vision models, particularly in segmenting objects in both synthetic and real-world datasets. The SLP mimics human visual attention by encouraging slots to select spatially contiguous patches in an image, leading to improved object segmentation and robustness to hyperparameter selection.",
