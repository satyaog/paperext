    "description": "This paper introduces a novel method to learn a Lyapunov function and a policy for robotic motion planning using a single neural network. The method imposes stability constraints to ensure the policy is stable and includes an obstacle avoidance module for safe navigation. The approach is validated in simulated environments and through real-world experiments.",
