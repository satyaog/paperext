    "description": "This paper introduces a method for controllable image generation using image collages as a means to specify scene elements, their appearance, and their spatial positions. The approach, called Mixing and Matching scenes (M&Ms), leverages an adversarially trained generative model conditioned on the collages and evaluates its performance on the OpenImages and MS-COCO datasets.",
