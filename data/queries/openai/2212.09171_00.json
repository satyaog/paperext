    "description": "The paper focuses on developing an Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection framework named RAINPROOF, specifically for text generators. It presents methods that can successfully detect OOD samples and enhance task-specific performance metrics. Additionally, the paper introduces a new benchmark, LOFTER, for evaluating OOD detection in text generation.",
