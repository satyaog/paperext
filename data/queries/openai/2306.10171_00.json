    "description": "This paper explores the construction of state representations in reinforcement learning (RL) through the use of auxiliary objectives, specifically bootstrapping methods. The authors provide a theoretical characterization of the state representation learned by temporal difference (TD) learning and contrast it with Monte Carlo and residual gradient algorithms. New auxiliary learning rules are designed based on the theoretical analysis, and an empirical comparison of these learning rules is conducted using classic domains such as the Four Rooms and Mountain Car. The study aims to address the gap in understanding which features these bootstrapping algorithms capture.",
