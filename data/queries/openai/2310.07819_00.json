    "description": "This paper addresses the challenge of ensuring faithfulness in importance measures for NLP by proposing a novel methodology that incorporates masking during fine-tuning to maintain in-distribution behavior. This allows for more accurate measurement of faithfulness through various importance measures.",

      "value": "empirical",
      "justification": "The paper presents a novel method and validates it through experiments on multiple datasets, which is characteristic of empirical research.",
      "quote": "This work proposes an inherently faithfulness measurable model that addresses these challenges. This is achieved using a novel fine-tuning method that incorporates masking, such that masking tokens become in-distribution by design. ...We demonstrate the generality of our approach by applying it to 16 different datasets and validate it using statistical in-distribution tests."
