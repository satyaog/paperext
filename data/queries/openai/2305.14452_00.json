    "description": "The paper proposes a downscaling method based on Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) that enables climate simulations at arbitrary high resolution from low-resolution input without the need for high-resolution training data. It outperforms state-of-the-art convolutional and generative adversarial downscaling models in both standard single-resolution downscaling and zero-shot generalization to higher upsampling factors.",
