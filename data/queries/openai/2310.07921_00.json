    "description": "This paper investigates a large number of Android sports apps available in the Google Play Store. It aims to understand the characteristics of these apps, the topics in user reviews, and the factors contributing to negative user opinions. The study combines qualitative and quantitative analyses, covering over 2,000 sports apps and their reviews, and provides insights for sports app developers.",
