    "description": "The paper explores a new method called Qualitative Code Suggestion (QCS), which aims to assist qualitative coders by providing a ranked list of code suggestions for identified passages in text corpora. This method considers the order of passage annotations, the importance of rare codes, and varying annotation styles between coders. The authors introduce the CVDQuoding dataset, featuring interviews with women at risk of cardiovascular diseases, to investigate QCS, and validate its effectiveness through human evaluations.",
