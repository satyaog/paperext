    },
    "description": "The paper proposes a novel method for automatic soft segmentation of the spinal cord across various MRI contrasts. The method leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) and introduces a new pipeline to generate a single, soft ground truth (GT) segmentation that averages segmentations across various MRI contrasts. By training with these soft GT masks and using a regression-based adaptive wing loss function, the model reduces the variability in cross-sectional area (CSA) across different MRI contrasts, achieving better generalization in spinal cord segmentation and improving predictions on unseen data with pathologies or different MRI parameters.",
