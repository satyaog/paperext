    "description": "This paper presents a novel, conditional generative probabilistic model of set-valued data with tractable log density. The model is a continuous normalizing flow governed by permutation equivariant dynamics, driven by learnable per-set-element and pairwise interactions. Applications include complex traffic scene generation and object bounding box generation.",
