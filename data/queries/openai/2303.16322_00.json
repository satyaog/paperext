    "description": "This paper introduces FMAS, a fast multi-objective neural architecture search framework designed for semantic segmentation. The framework uses DeepLabV3+ as a supernet to search for computationally efficient models and evaluates these models on a subset of the validation dataset to speed up the search process. The best models are then fine-tuned using the complete training set. The effectiveness of FMAS is demonstrated on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset.",
