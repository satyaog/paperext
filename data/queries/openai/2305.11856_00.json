    "description": "This paper introduces and evaluates a new aerial image-based map (AIM) representation for multi-agent trajectory prediction in autonomous driving. The proposed AIM requires minimal annotation and is incorporated into a differentiable driving simulator to improve prediction accuracy for pedestrians and vehicles when compared with traditional rasterized HD maps.",
    "type": {
      "value": "Empirical Study",
      "justification": "The paper focuses on evaluating the performance of the proposed AIM representation using experimental data and validation against existing methods.",
      "quote": "We evaluate multi-agent trajectory prediction using the AIM by incorporating it into a differentiable driving simulator as an image-texture-based differentiable rendering module. Our results demonstrate competitive multi-agent trajectory prediction performance especially for pedestrians in the scene when using our AIM representation as compared to models trained with rasterized HD maps."
