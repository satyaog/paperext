    "description": "This paper introduces Lag-Llama, a foundation model for univariate probabilistic time series forecasting. The model is based on a decoder-only transformer architecture that uses lags as covariates and is pretrained on a large corpus of diverse time series data from several domains. The paper demonstrates Lag-Llama's strong zero-shot generalization capabilities and its state-of-the-art performance when fine-tuned on new datasets.",

      "quote": "We demonstrate the strong few-shot adaptation performance of Lag-Llama on previously unseen datasets, across varying fractions of data history being available. We investigate the diversity of the pretraining corpus used to train Lag-Llama, and present the scaling laws of Lag-Llama with respect to the pretraining data."
