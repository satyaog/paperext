    "description": "This paper proposes the concept of Feature Conformal Prediction (Feature CP), which extends the conformal prediction technique to semantic feature spaces instead of being limited to the output space. This extension leverages the inductive bias of deep representation learning to achieve better efficiency and effectiveness in predictive inference tasks, such as ImageNet classification and Cityscapes image segmentation.",

Apart from experiments on existing predictive inference benchmarks, we also demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed methods on large-scale tasks such as ImageNet classification and Cityscapes image segmentation."
