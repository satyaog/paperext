    "description": "The paper investigates the coordination of root phosphatase activity with various root traits along a phosphorus availability gradient in tropical forests. Using measurements of root traits such as root diameter, specific root length, root tissue density, and nitrogen concentration among others, it aims to understand how different tree species adapt their phosphorus acquisition strategies to varying levels of soil phosphorus.",

      "quote": "We measured root PME activity and commonly-measured root traits, including root diameter, specific root length (SRL), root tissue density (RTD), and nitrogen concentration ([N]) in 18 co-occurring trees across soils with varying P availability to better understand trees response to P supply."

Similarly, mycorrhizal plant species are expected to follow a general pattern whereby they rely more heavily on mycorrhizal partners for nutrient acquisition as P supply declines (Treseder, 2004; Ma et al., 2021)."
