    "description": "This paper introduces a framework for augmenting static datasets with useful synthetic samples based on feedback from the classifier to the generative model. The framework is designed to be effective in balanced class distribution for imbalanced scenarios by ensuring that the samples generated are close to the support of the real data and are sufficiently diverse. The approach is validated on imbalanced datasets ImageNet-LT and NICO++ and shows state-of-the-art improvements.",
