    "description": "This paper presents the Diffusion Generative Flow Sampler (DGFS), a sampling-based framework designed to address the issue of sampling from intractable high-dimensional density functions. DGFS utilizes partial trajectory optimization, allowing it to generate intermediate learning signals and thus improve sampling accuracy and learning efficiency.",

      "justification": "The paper includes various experiments, benchmarking different methods across multiple tasks and presenting empirical results to demonstrate performance.",
