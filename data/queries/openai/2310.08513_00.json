    "description": "This paper investigates the impact of initial weight structures, particularly their effective rank, on the learning dynamics of neural networks. It demonstrates that high-rank initializations lead to lazier learning, whereas low-rank initializations result in richer learning. These findings are grounded in theoretical derivations and empirical validations using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on various tasks.",
