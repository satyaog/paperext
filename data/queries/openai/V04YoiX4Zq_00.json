    "description": "The paper proposes DiffusionExplorer, a framework that efficiently probes large vision foundation models for their vulnerabilities using diffusion generation. It generates test sets with novel combinations of objects and nuisances to expose model weaknesses, significantly reducing the accuracy of models like MiniGPT-4 and LLaVa. This suggests that generative models can be an effective source for creating challenging test data.",
