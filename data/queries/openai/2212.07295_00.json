    "description": "This paper investigates the maximal initial learning rate for deep ReLU networks, defined as the largest learning rate at which a randomly initialized neural network can begin training and achieve a given threshold accuracy. The study explores the relationship between this learning rate, the network’s architecture, and the sharpness of the network at initialization. Empirical and theoretical analyses suggest a power-law relationship between the maximal initial learning rate and the product of the network’s depth and width.",
