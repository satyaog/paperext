    "description": "This paper introduces Graph Output Attribution (GOAt), a novel method aimed at improving the interpretability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The method attributes graph outputs to input graph features, providing explanations that are faithful, discriminative, and stable. Extensive experiments show that GOAt outperforms state-of-the-art explainers in terms of fidelity, discriminability, and stability.",
