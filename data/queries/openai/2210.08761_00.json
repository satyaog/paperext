    "description": "This paper presents a novel approach for protein sequence and structure co-design that uses equivariant translation. Specifically, the method involves a trigonometry-aware encoder and a roto-translation equivariant decoder, which iteratively translate both protein sequence and structure into the desired state from random initialization, thereby accelerating the inference process significantly. The approach shows superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines across multiple tasks.",
