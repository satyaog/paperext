    "description": "The paper proposes a modular design for neural networks that disentangle and recombine different facets of knowledge to generalise more systematically to new tasks. Different tasks are associated with subsets of latent skills, each corresponding to a parameter-efficient model adapter. The model jointly learns the adapters and a routing function to allocate skills to each task. The approach is evaluated on multitask reinforcement learning and few-shot fine-tuning in language models, showing improvements over fully shared, task-specific, or conditionally generated models as well as sparse mixture-of-experts models.",
