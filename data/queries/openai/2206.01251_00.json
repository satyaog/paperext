    "description": "This paper proposes a framework to evaluate self-supervised learning (SSL) models by measuring the expressiveness and learnability of the representations. Specifically, intrinsic dimension (ID) is used to assess expressiveness, and Cluster Learnability (CL) is introduced to assess learnability. The combined predictor, CLID, is shown to correlate well with model performance across different SSL methods and tasks.",
