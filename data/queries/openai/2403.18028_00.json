    "description": "This paper addresses the challenge of predicting species occurrence patterns given satellite imagery and known information on the occurrence of other species. To tackle this, the authors introduce a dataset named SatButterfly and propose a model called R-Tran. The study evaluates the performance of R-Tran in predicting species encounter rates using partial information and finds that it outperforms other methods both within and across taxa.",
