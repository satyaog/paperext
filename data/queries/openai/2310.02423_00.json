    "description": "This paper introduces Delta-AI, a novel algorithm for amortized inference in sparse probabilistic graphical models. The method leverages local credit assignment in the agent's policy learning objective, inspired by generative flow networks (GFlowNets), thus enabling off-policy training and significantly accelerating the training process. The approach is validated through experiments on synthetic PGMs and training latent variable models with sparse factor structure, showing faster convergence and efficiency over existing methods.",
