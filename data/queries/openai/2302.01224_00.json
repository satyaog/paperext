    "description": "The paper investigates three [0, ∞]-valued propositional logics interpreted over the Lawvere quantale. These logics aim to provide a foundation for quantitative metric reasoning by incorporating basic logical connectives that can be interpreted in any quantale. The paper further develops natural deduction systems for these logics, proving their decidable completeness with respect to the quantale-valued semantics, and discusses the consistency of these logics. Moreover, the work shows incompleteness results and provides a normalization algorithm, establishing the decidability of satisfiability within these systems. Special attention is given to quantitative equational logic, indicating how it can be interpreted within one of these proposed logics, supporting theories with axiomatic systems or inference systems.",
