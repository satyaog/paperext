    "description": "This paper presents two equivalent ex post conditions for the exactness of any conic relaxation of the Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem. These conditions act as exactness certificates for the computed solution, ensuring optimality even when traditional a priori exactness conditions are not met. Numerical examples using the MATPOWER library are provided to illustrate the use of these conditions.",
