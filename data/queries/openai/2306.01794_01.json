    "description": "This paper introduces DiffPack, a torsional diffusion model designed for autoregressive protein side-chain packing. The model aims to address limitations in traditional and existing machine learning methods, leveraging an autoregressive diffusion process to generate the four torsional angles of protein side chains. The proposed method improves angle accuracy on CASP13 and CASP14 benchmarks with significantly fewer parameters, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting protein side-chain conformations.",

      "quote": "We evaluate the method on several benchmarks for protein side-chain packing and show that our method achieves improvements of 11.9% and 13.5% in angle accuracy on CASP13 and CASP14, respectively."
