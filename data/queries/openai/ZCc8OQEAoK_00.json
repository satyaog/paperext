    "description": "The paper discusses innovative approaches in improving the scalability and performance of non-parametric Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The authors introduce a novel module, non-parametric attention (NPA), aimed at overcoming the over-smoothing issues and fixed-weight limitations of existing non-parametric models. The effectiveness of NPA is validated through extensive experiments on homophilic and heterophilic graphs, showing significant performance improvements.",
