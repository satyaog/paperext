    "description": "This paper addresses the phenomenon in Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) where removing the last few layers of a trained network significantly improves performance on downstream tasks. The study introduces and explores the concept of Guillotine Regularization and investigates how the optimal layer to remove depends on training optimization, training data, and downstream tasks.",
