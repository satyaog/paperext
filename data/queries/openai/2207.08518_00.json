    "description": "The paper introduces HiFormer, a novel method that integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers for medical image segmentation. The method leverages a CNN-based encoder and Swin Transformer to capture both global and local features and employs a Double-Level Fusion (DLF) module to effectively merge these features. The paper presents the effectiveness of HiFormer across various medical image segmentation datasets.",
