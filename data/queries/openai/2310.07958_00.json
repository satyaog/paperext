    "description": "This paper addresses the challenge of non-robust features in deep learning models used for vulnerability detection by incorporating causality. The approach, CausalVul, uses perturbations to discover and eliminate spurious features from a model's predictions and applies causal learning algorithms to improve accuracy, robustness, and generalization to out-of-distribution data.",
