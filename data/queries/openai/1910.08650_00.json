    "description": "The paper explores methods for differentiating between out-of-distribution (OOD) sets to select the most effective one for training calibrated convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for OOD detection. The authors propose computationally efficient metrics based on generalization errors of augmented-CNNs (A-CNNs) and verify their effectiveness empirically.",
