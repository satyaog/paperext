    "description": "The paper explores the problem of solving stochastic monotone variational inequalities with a separable structure using a stochastic first-order oracle. The authors propose a novel algorithm called stochastic accelerated gradient-extragradient (AG-EG) for strongly monotone variational inequalities. The algorithm combines the strengths of extragradient methods and Nesterov acceleration to achieve an optimal convergence rate.",
