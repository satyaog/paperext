    "description": "The paper offers a review of biases in Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS) by surveying recent literature and examining biases across the system’s pipeline. It explores biases in classic recommender systems and their relevance to CRS, also addressing specific biases within CRS involving language models, dialogue systems, and natural language understanding. The study emphasizes the importance of a holistic approach to manage biases in complex CRS models.",
