    "description": "This paper introduces T-PHATE, a nonlinear manifold learning method for time-series data such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). T-PHATE captures the autocorrelative structure of time-series data to denoise and reveal dynamic trajectories. The paper empirically validates T-PHATE on three fMRI datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in data visualization, classification, and segmentation compared to several state-of-the-art dimensionality-reduction benchmarks.",
