    "description": "This paper investigates the biases in deep learning (DL) models used in medical image analysis, focusing on the fairness and accuracy of their uncertainty estimates. It experiments on three clinically relevant tasks: skin lesion classification, brain tumor segmentation, and Alzheimer’s disease clinical score regression, revealing the trade-offs between performance and uncertainty quantification.",

      "quote": "In this work, we present the first exploration of the effect of popular fairness models on overcoming biases across subgroups in medical image analysis in terms of bottom-line performance, and their effects on uncertainty quantification. We perform extensive experiments on three different clinically relevant tasks: (i) skin lesion classification, (ii) brain tumour segmentation, and (iii) Alzheimer’s disease clinical score regression."

        "quote": "Although deep learning (DL) models have shown great success in many medical image analysis tasks, deployment of the resulting models into real clinical contexts requires: (1) that they exhibit robustness and fairness across different sub-populations, and (2) that the confidence in DL model predictions be accurately expressed in the form of uncertainties."
