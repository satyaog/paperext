    "description": "The paper investigates the effectiveness of a technique named Guillotine Regularization, where the last few layers of a trained deep network, often called the projector head, are removed to improve the generalization performance of self-supervised learning (SSL) models. The study explores the reasons for the success of this technique and examines how changes in training setup, data, and downstream tasks can impact the optimal layer to use.",
