    "description": "This paper proposes Metro, a Memory-Enhanced Transformer model for retrosynthetic planning via reaction trees. A new benchmark of 124,869 reaction trees is created from the USPTO-full dataset. Experimental results show that Metro significantly outperforms existing models in top-1 accuracy, demonstrating the importance of context information in retrosynthetic planning.",
