    "description": "This paper presents a projection-free algorithm for online convex optimization (OCO) with time-varying equality and generalized inequality constraints, named OIPM-TEC. Additionally, it introduces an alternative algorithm, epsilon-OIPM-TEC, with a focus on epsilon-regret for more computationally efficient performance assessments. The efficacy of these algorithms is illustrated through an online optimal power flow (OPF) problem in electric grids.",
