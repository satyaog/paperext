    "description": "This research paper introduces E3Bind, an end-to-end equivariant network designed for predicting the docking pose of ligands to protein targets. Unlike traditional methods and some recent deep learning models, E3Bind iteratively refines the ligand pose with special attention to geometric constraints. The model demonstrates enhanced performance over other methods with experiments on standard benchmark datasets.",
