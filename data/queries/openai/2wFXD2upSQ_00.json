    "description": "This paper reassesses the phenomenon of dying neurons in neural networks, traditionally seen as undesirable, and explores their potential for facilitating efficient structured pruning. The authors introduce Demon’s Pruning (DemP), a method that uses hyperparameter configurations to promote neuron death, thereby dynamically sparsifying networks during training and improving the accuracy-compression tradeoff compared to existing methods.",
