It aims to differentiate between ML and non-ML bugs and to understand their distribution, complexity, root causes, symptoms, and resource demands.",

After multiple filtering steps, we select the top 300 repositories with the highest number of closed issues. We manually investigate the extracted repositories to exclude non-ML- based systems..."
