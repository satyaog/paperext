    "description": "This study focuses on enhancing the imaging quality of the cervical spinal cord using MRI at 3 Tesla by implementing dynamic shimming techniques. The primary aim is to correct magnetic field inhomogeneities that cause image artifacts by employing a novel approach termed realtime dynamic shimming. The study replicates prior work on z-shimming and introduces improvements by incorporating in-plane compensation gradients to address respiration-induced magnetic field variations.",
