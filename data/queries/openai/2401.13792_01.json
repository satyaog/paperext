    "description": "The paper addresses the challenge of load balancing in multi-band 5G and beyond networks, proposing a probabilistic mobility load balancing (PMLB) algorithm. The algorithm models load balancing as a multi-objective stochastic optimization problem, aiming to distribute user equipment (UE) traffic evenly across bands while minimizing handovers. The approach leverages linear programming and event-based operations to enhance network performance, as demonstrated through simulation results.",
