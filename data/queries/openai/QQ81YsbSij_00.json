    "description": "The paper presents a method for designing novel and stable crystalline materials conditioned on a desired band gap using offline reinforcement learning. It formulates crystal design as a sequential decision-making problem and uses conservative Q-learning to learn a conditional policy. The generated materials are evaluated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations.",
