    "description": "This paper introduces the StatCan Dialogue Dataset consisting of over 19,000 conversation turns between Statistics Canada agents and online users. The dataset features genuine intents and is available in English or French. The paper proposes two tasks based on the dataset: automatic table retrieval and response generation. Experiments demonstrate that existing models struggle with these tasks, particularly with generalizing to future conversations.",
