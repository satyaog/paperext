    "description": "This paper presents Lag-Llama, a univariate probabilistic time-series forecasting model trained on a large collection of time-series data. The paper studies the model's zero-shot prediction capabilities, performance on out-of-distribution datasets, and its scaling behavior. The model shows good zero-shot prediction capabilities on unseen datasets, outperforming several supervised baselines. Additionally, the study includes fitting neural scaling laws to predict the model's performance based on model size.",
