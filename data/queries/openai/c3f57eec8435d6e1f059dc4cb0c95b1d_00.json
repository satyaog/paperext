    "description": "The paper explores the role of transposable elements (TEs) in T-cell development within the thymus, particularly focusing on their expression in various thymic cell types such as medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). Through multi-omic analyses, it investigates how TEs interact with transcription factors, contribute to the immunopeptidome, and vary with age and cell lineage, proposing that regulated TE expression is crucial for preventing autoimmunity.",
