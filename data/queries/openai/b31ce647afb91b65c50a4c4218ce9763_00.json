    "description": "This paper investigates the genome-wide regulatory differences and the effects of disease risk variants in individuals with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) by analyzing chromatin accessibility and single-cell gene-expression profiles in cells from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The study identifies specific cell types and regulatory mechanisms that may contribute to MDD.",
