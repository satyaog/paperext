    "description": "The paper discusses the importance of reflecting on study limitations in software engineering research and proposes a focus on trade-offs to improve the understanding and reporting of these limitations. It introduces guidelines for documenting trade-offs to promote better assessment and replication of research.",

      "value": "theoretical",
      "justification": "The paper focuses on discussing ideas and introducing guidelines related to research methodologies in software engineering, rather than providing experimental results.",
      "quote": "We propose to evolve the existing practice of communicating threats to validity into a richly detailed commentary of the design trade-offs made for a study."
