    "description": "The paper proposes a method named Reset Free RL with Intelligently Switching Controller (RISC), which intelligently switches between two agents (a forward agent and a reset agent) based on the agent’s confidence in achieving its current goal. The method aims to improve state-of-the-art performance on challenging reset-free reinforcement learning environments by reducing time spent in already explored regions of the state space and reducing the average distance to goal states.",
