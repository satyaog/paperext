    "description": "This paper explores the scaling properties of weakly supervised classifiers and self-supervised masked autoencoders (MAEs) when applied to microscopy images in biological research. It introduces a new channel-agnostic MAE architecture and demonstrates the effectiveness of MAEs, particularly ViT-based MAEs, in improving the recall of known biological relationships. The study uses various large-scale microscopy datasets and proposes novel methodologies like Fourier domain reconstruction to stabilize MAE training. The goal is to create robust foundation models for cellular biology that can advance drug discovery.",
