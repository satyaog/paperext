    "description": "This paper presents Multi-Objective GFlowNets (MOGFNs), a novel method for generating diverse Pareto optimal solutions in multi-objective optimization tasks. MOGFNs leverage Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to introduce diversity among the generated solutions. The paper introduces two variants of MOGFNs: MOGFN-PC and MOGFN-AL. MOGFN-PC tackles the problem by conditioning on preferences over objectives, while MOGFN-AL integrates an active learning loop for more efficient sample generation. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of MOGFNs through experiments on various synthetic and benchmark tasks, showing improvements in both Pareto performance and candidate diversity.",
