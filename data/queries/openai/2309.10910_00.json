    "description": "This paper explores the use of cross-dataset transfer learning to enhance pathology detection in EEG signals. It demonstrates the effectiveness of data and model scaling when transferring knowledge from a source dataset to a target dataset, especially in scenarios with limited labeled data. The study evaluates performance improvements with different models and highlights critical factors such as data normalization and preprocessing for achieving positive transfer.",
