    "description": "This paper introduces ÌròyìnSpeech, a new Yorùbá speech corpus aimed at increasing the amount of high-quality, contemporary Yorùbá speech data for Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) tasks. The corpus comprises about 42 hours of speech data recorded by 80 volunteers and includes contributions to the Mozilla Common Voice platform. The paper also presents evaluation results for TTS and ASR models, providing baselines for future research.",
