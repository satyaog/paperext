    "description": "The paper introduces Neural FIM, a method for computing the Fisher Information Metric from point cloud data to create a continuous manifold model. The method leverages a neural network for embedding data points into a latent space and deriving the metric, allowing for the analysis and visualization of manifold characteristics such as volume, geodesics, and branching points. The paper showcases the method's utility in selecting parameters for the PHATE visualization method and its application on toy datasets and single-cell data.",
