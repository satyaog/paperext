    "description": "This paper introduces Contrastive Retrospection (ConSpec), a new reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm designed to hone in on critical steps for success using offline contrastive learning. The algorithm can be added to existing RL setups to improve identification and generalization of these critical steps across various tasks. The paper demonstrates that ConSpec significantly improves learning efficiency and out-of-distribution generalization across diverse RL tasks including grid-world, Atari, and 3D environments.",

During testing, a black table or box was presented, even though the agent had never seen black objects before. The prototype that recognized picking up flat objects immediately generalized to black flat objects (Fig. 3b). Thanks to this, the agent with ConSpec solved the task with the black objects in zero-shot (Fig. 3e). This shows that ConSpec was able to learn prototypes that discovered an invariant feature among successes (flatness), and was not confused by irrelevant sensory features such as colour, permitting it to generalize to contingencies involving colours never seen before."

With these works, ConSpec shares the principle that transforming the RL problem into a classification task is beneficial. But these works typically use the contrastive approach to learn whole policies or value functions. In distinction to this, ConSpec uses contrastive learning for the purpose of learning prototype representations for recognizing critical steps in order to shape the reward function, thereby enabling rapid learning and generalization."
