    "description": "This paper explores the relationship between social isolation and various classical risk factors associated with Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (ADRD). Using data from two large-scale population cohorts, the UK Biobank and the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA), the study investigates subjective loneliness and objective social support in relation to well-established ADRD risk factors. The findings suggest that social isolation is significantly linked to a wide range of dementia risk factors, offering insight for potential preventive measures.",
