    "description": "The paper presents the use of the Galaxy Morphology Posterior Estimation Network (GaMPEN) to estimate morphological parameters and associated uncertainties for approximately 8 million galaxies in the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Wide survey. By applying transfer learning on simulated galaxies and real data, GaMPEN achieves high accuracy in predicting full Bayesian posteriors for galaxy morphological parameters, significantly outperforming traditional light-profile fitting algorithms.",
