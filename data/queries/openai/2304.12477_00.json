    "description": "The paper reveals the suboptimality of popular dynamic programming decompositions used in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with Conditional-Value-at-Risk (CVaR) and Entropic-Value-at-Risk (EVaR) risk measures. It provides a new proof showing the correctness of decompositions for Value-at-Risk (VaR) and proposes corrections for the identified issues. The paper includes theoretical proofs and counterexamples to demonstrate its claims.",
    "type": {
      "value": "Theoretical",
      "justification": "The primary contributions of the paper are new theoretical results, proofs, and counterexamples concerning the properties and correctness of dynamic programming decompositions for risk measures.",
      "quote": "In this paper, we make a surprising discovery that numerous claims of optimality of risk-level decompositions published in the past several years are incorrect. [...] Our results also affect applications of these algorithms, such as automated vehicle motion planning (Jin et al., 2019). We also identify gaps in related decompositions (Li et al., 2022; Ni and Lai, 2022) and propose how to fix them."
