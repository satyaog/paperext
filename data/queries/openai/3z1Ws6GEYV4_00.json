The paper features two variants: Preference-Conditional GFlowNets (MOGFN-PC) and MOGFN-AL for active learning settings. Empirical results demonstrate that MOGFNs outperform existing methods in terms of hypervolume, R2-distance, and candidate diversity while offering insights into their design.",

For instance, in the drug discovery scenario, evaluating objectives such as the binding energy to a target even in simulations can take several hours. Sample-efficiency, in terms of number of evaluations of the objective functions, and diversity of candidates, thus become critical in such scenarios. Black-box optimization approaches involving active learning (Zuluaga et al., 2013), particularly multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) methods (Shah & Ghahramani, 2016; Garnett, 2022) are powerful approaches in these settings."
