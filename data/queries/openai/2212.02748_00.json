    "description": "The paper proposes the Online Projected Equality-constrained Newton Method (OPEN-M) for online optimization problems with time-varying linear equality constraints. The method achieves sublinear dynamic regret and constraint violation bounds under mild conditions and demonstrates superior performance in numerical experiments compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.",
