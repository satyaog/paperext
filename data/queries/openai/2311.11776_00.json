    "description": "The paper argues for the necessity of including adverse impact statements in Responsible AI (RAI) research. It highlights the shortcomings in current RAI research regarding the reflection on possible negative outcomes and offers suggestions for more meaningful engagement with the impact of such research.",

      "quote": "This trend of failing to reflect on the possible negative impact of our own work should concern all of us, as the research we conduct and the artifacts we build are more often than not value-laden..."
