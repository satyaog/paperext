    "description": "This paper introduces Implicit Diffusion, an algorithm for optimizing distributions defined implicitly by parameterized stochastic diffusions. The algorithm modifies the outcome distribution of sampling processes by optimizing their parameters, performing optimization and sampling steps jointly in a single loop. It provides theoretical guarantees and demonstrates effectiveness in real-world settings through experimental results.",

Increasingly, sampling algorithms rely on iteratively applying large-scale parameterized functions (e.g. neural networks with trainable weights) to samples, such as in denoising diffusion models."
