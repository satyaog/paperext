    "description": "This paper introduces a method called Model Breadcrumbs for effectively merging multiple fine-tunings of a foundational model across various tasks. The approach aims to address scalability, noise reduction, and hyperparameter generalization in multi-task model merging without additional training or access to the original training data. It accomplishes this by creating sparse masks based on weight differences from fine-tuned models, thus enabling efficient and robust model merging.",
