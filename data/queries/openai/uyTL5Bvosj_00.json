    "description": "The paper introduces the Beyond the Imitation Game benchmark (BIG-bench), which aims to evaluate the capabilities of large language models across a wide variety of tasks that are currently beyond current models' capabilities. It evaluates models like OpenAI's GPT, Google's dense transformer architectures, and Switch-style sparse transformers on these tasks, discusses trends in model performance, calibration, and the appearance of breakthrough capabilities. Human expert evaluations are also provided for benchmarking.",
