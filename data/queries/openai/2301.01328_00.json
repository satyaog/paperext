    "description": "This paper presents a deep spectroscopic survey using MUSE at the VLT to study Lyman-α emission in the SPT2349-56 protocluster system at redshift z = 4.3. The study reveals a few Lyman-α emitters and an extended Lyman-α structure that could be fueled by dusty star-forming galaxies.",
