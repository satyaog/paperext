    "description": "This paper proposes Omega, a new method inspired by the optimistic gradient method. Omega aims to improve convergence and efficiency in stochastic min-max optimization problems by incorporating an exponential moving average (EMA) of historic gradients in its updates. The authors introduce variants of Omega, such as one that includes momentum, and demonstrate that Omega outperforms traditional optimistic gradient methods in certain stochastic games. The paper highlights that Omega requires fewer gradient computations than other competitive methods, making it a more computationally efficient alternative.",
