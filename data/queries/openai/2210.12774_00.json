    "description": "This paper proposes a novel manifold alignment method called MALI (Manifold Alignment with Label Information) that learns a correspondence between two distinct domains by leveraging the diffusion process and discrete class labels. It aims at finding a common representation for two domains and can be applied to domain adaptation problems. The method outperforms current state-of-the-art manifold alignment algorithms in multiple datasets.",
