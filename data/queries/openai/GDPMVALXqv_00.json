    "description": "The paper investigates a retrieval-based approach for reducing bias and toxicity in responses from chatbots using in-context learning. It retrieves demonstrations of safe responses to unsafe dialogue contexts to steer the model towards safer generations. The approach is competitive with existing methods without requiring additional training.",

      "quote": "we propose retrieving demonstrations of exemplary safe responses to similar dialogue contexts. We find our method performs competitively with existing approaches to dialogue safety without requiring training. We also show, using automatic and human evaluation, that reductions in toxicity obtained using our approach are not at the cost engagingness or coherency."
