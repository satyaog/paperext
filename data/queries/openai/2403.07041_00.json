    "description": "This paper introduces the Generative Flow Ant Colony Sampler (GFACS), a novel neural-guided meta-heuristic algorithm for combinatorial optimization. GFACS integrates Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) with the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) methodology to enhance ACO by providing an informed prior distribution of decision variables. The paper demonstrates that GFACS outperforms baseline ACO algorithms in various combinatorial optimization tasks and is competitive with problem-specific heuristics for vehicle routing problems.",
