    "description": "This paper proposes a novel learning framework called Generative Augmented Flow Networks (GAFlowNets) to incorporate intermediate rewards into Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets). The approach aims to improve exploration in environments with sparse rewards through intrinsic motivation and demonstrates its effectiveness through extensive experiments on the GridWorld task and a molecule generation domain.",

We further show that GAFlowNet is scalable to a more complex and large-scale molecule generation domain, where it achieves consistent and significant performance improvement."
