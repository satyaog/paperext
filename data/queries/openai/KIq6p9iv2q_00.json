    "description": "This paper explores the loss of plasticity in neural networks trained on nonstationary data distributions, identifies the independent mechanisms causing this loss, and proposes a unified training protocol to maintain plasticity. It validates its approach in synthetic nonstationary tasks, reinforcement learning, and natural distribution shifts.",

      "value": "Empirical study",
      "justification": "The paper involves experiments and empirical analyses in various domains like synthetic nonstationary tasks, reinforcement learning, and distribution shifts.",
      "quote": "We validate this approach in a variety of synthetic nonstationary learning tasks, and further demonstrate its effectiveness on two naturally arising nonstationarities: reinforcement learning in the arcade learning environment, and by an adaptation of the WiLDS distribution shift benchmark."

        "quote": "Our analysis of these mechanisms sheds new light onto the well-known phenomenon of dormant neurons, revealing that saturated ReLU units are a symptom of a deeper underlying pathology in the network’s optimization dynamics characterized by shifts in the distribution of preactivations, which can cause plasticity loss even in non-saturating nonlinearities."
