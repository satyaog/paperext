    "description": "This paper presents a method to design novel and stable crystalline materials conditioned on a desired band gap by using offline reinforcement learning with conservative Q-learning. The study formulates crystal design as a sequential decision-making problem and evaluates the generated materials using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results are compared with baselines like random policy and behavioral cloning.",
