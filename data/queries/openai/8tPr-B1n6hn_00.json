    "description": "This paper presents an ensemble method named Deep MAGIC, which combines the MAGIC imputation method and a denoising autoencoder model to address the problem of missing data in various datasets. The experimental results indicate that Deep MAGIC outperforms several state-of-the-art imputation methods, particularly at higher dropout rates, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.",
