    "description": "The paper theoretically shows that conservative objective models (COMs) for offline model-based optimization (MBO) are a specific type of contrastive divergence-based energy model. The authors propose improvements to these models by introducing a Langevin MCMC sampler and decoupling the modeling of unconditional and conditional probabilities. They demonstrate their theoretical findings and proposed methods on a toy dataset.",
