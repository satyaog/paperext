    "description": "This paper proposes a deep multi-representation learning (DML) framework for data clustering, where difficult-to-cluster data groups are associated with their own optimized latent spaces. Autoencoders are used to generate both cluster-specific and general latent spaces, and a novel loss function combining weighted reconstruction and clustering losses is introduced. The method outperforms state-of-the-art clustering approaches, especially on imbalanced datasets.",
