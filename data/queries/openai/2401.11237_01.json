    "description": "The paper investigates the stitching property in reinforcement learning (RL), which allows RL algorithms to generalize and solve tasks not seen during training. It compares RL methods based on dynamic programming with supervised learning (SL) based methods. The paper finds that SL-based methods often lack this stitching property but proposes a temporal data augmentation technique to improve their performance.",

      "value": "empirical",
      "justification": "The paper presents both theoretical analysis and empirical experiments to study the stitching property and the effectiveness of temporal data augmentation.",
      "quote": "Our empirical results support the theory: we demonstrate that prior RL methods based on SL (DT [2] and RvS [3]) fail to perform stitching, even when trained on abundant quantities of data."
