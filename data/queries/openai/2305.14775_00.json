    "description": "This paper proposes a framework (XTEVAL) to measure the gap between knowledge acquired and utilized by Pretrained Language Models (PLMs). The framework extracts knowledge from the PLMs and constructs downstream tasks to evaluate how much of this knowledge is applied in these tasks.",
