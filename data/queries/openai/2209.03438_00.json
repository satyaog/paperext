    "description": "The paper proposes SmOOD, a smoothness-based out-of-distribution (OOD) detection approach for feedforward neural networks (FNNs) used as surrogate models in aircraft design. SmOOD identifies high-risk OOD inputs by exploiting inherent smoothness properties of high-fidelity simulations, enabling more accurate yet efficient surrogate-driven design optimizations.",
