    "description": "This paper introduces a novel method for knowledge distillation called TGeo-KD, which learns a sample-wise knowledge fusion ratio by leveraging trilateral geometric relations among student predictions, teacher predictions, and ground truths. The method is shown to be effective across various architectures and model sizes, with extensive experiments demonstrating consistent improvements over other loss re-weighting methods in tasks such as image classification, attack detection, and click-through rate prediction.",
