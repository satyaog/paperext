    "description": "This paper introduces a scalable framework called POYO for modeling neural population dynamics using large-scale neural recordings. The framework includes a novel tokenization method and a PerceiverIO architecture which enable the integration of multiple neural datasets for robust decoding. Additionally, it discusses the benefits of multi-session training and develops two large-scale pretrained models, POYO-1 and POYO-mp.",
