    "description": "This paper provides a comprehensive survey on the topic of result diversification in search and recommendation systems. It proposes a unified taxonomy to classify the metrics and approaches used to enhance diversity in these systems. The survey covers both the importance of diversity in retrieval systems and the existing methods to measure and improve it. It also discusses the open challenges and future directions in this field.",
