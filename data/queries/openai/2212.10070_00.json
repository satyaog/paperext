    "description": "This paper addresses the challenge of achieving fairness in decision-making problems involving multiple stakeholders and a central decision maker making repeated decisions over time. It introduces a mathematical programming framework that focuses on fairness while preserving decision efficiency. The paper proposes a reformulation to mitigate complexity introduced by symmetry in such problems, enabling easier implementation of branch-and-cut solvers. A relaxed version of this reformulated problem is also introduced, providing approximate solutions quickly using simultaneous row and column generation techniques.",

      "quote": "This paper examines repeated decisions on problems involving multiple stakeholders and a central decision maker. Repetition of the decision-making provides additional opportunities to promote fairness while increasing the complexity from symmetry to finding solutions."
