    "description": "This paper investigates the feasibility of conducting cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychology research in the extreme environment of a speleological (caving) expedition. It evaluates various measurement tools used to assess physiological, cognitive, and emotional states in such challenging conditions and provides recommendations for future research.",
    "type": {
      "value": "empirical",
      "justification": "The paper involves testing various data collection methods in a real-world setting of a speleological expedition and provides empirical results.",
      "quote": "The main goal of this project was to test the feasibility of conducting cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychology research in extreme environments, in this case during a speleological expedition."
