    "description": "The paper addresses the challenge of constructing predictive models capable of generalizing to a target domain without accessing target data, particularly in the context of evolving dynamics between domains. It proposes the use of Koopman Neural Operators to solve the Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) problem and introduces Temporal Koopman Networks (TKNets) to handle time-evolving distributions effectively. The approach is validated through empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets.",

For geological applications, the source samples can be collected along different altitudes, longitude, and latitude, while the target is to generalize to some regions where the data is absent due to inaccessibility. Medical data is also often collected with age or other indicators as intervals, and we hope the model can perform well on younger or elder age groups where the samples may be rare. As a more concrete example, Fig. 1(a) shows several instances from the rotated MNIST (RMNIST) dataset"
