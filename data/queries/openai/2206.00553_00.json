    "description": "The paper introduces techniques to verify, train, and predict individual fairness in neural network models. It proposes a tool called FETA, which incorporates counterexample-guided methods to guarantee fairness constraints during prediction and training. The effectiveness of these techniques is demonstrated through empirical evaluations on real-world datasets.",
