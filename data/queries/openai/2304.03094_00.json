    "description": "The paper proposes a new method called PopulAtion Parameter Averaging (PAPA) that combines multiple neural networks into one by averaging their weights, improving efficiency without sacrificing performance compared to traditional ensembling methods. PAPA leverages a population of diverse models and their weights are slowly pushed toward the population average during training.",
