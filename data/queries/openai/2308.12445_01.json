    "description": "The paper introduces Dr. DRL, a self-healing approach for deep reinforcement learning (DRL) systems. It leverages intentional forgetting to prioritize the adaptation of critical problem-solving skills in the face of environmental drifts. The approach uses continual learning (CL) combined with intentional forgetting to enhance the adaptability, reduce healing time, and improve performance of DRL agents in drifted environments.",
