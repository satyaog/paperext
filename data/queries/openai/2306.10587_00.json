    "description": "This paper seeks to build a unified paradigm for accelerating policy optimization methods in reinforcement learning. By incorporating foresight through optimistic and adaptive updates into the policy improvement step, the authors aim to create algorithms that better predict future behavior and adapt accordingly to mitigate errors. They also provide a general framework for expressing and analyzing other policy optimization algorithms in this context, and introduce an optimistic policy gradient algorithm enhanced through meta-gradient learning, investigating design choices empirically.",

Then, we design an optimistic policy gradient algorithm, adaptive via meta-gradient learning, and empirically highlight several design choices pertaining to acceleration, in an illustrative task."
