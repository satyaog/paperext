    "description": "This paper delves into the problem of assortment optimization under visibility constraints (APV), relevant to e-retail and online advertising. Given a universe of substitutable products and a stream of T customers, the goal is to determine the optimal assortment of products to offer to each customer to maximize total expected revenue while ensuring each product is displayed to a minimum number of customers. The study introduces the 'expanded revenue' function to aid in solving APV and provides a polynomial time algorithm. Additionally, the paper examines APV under cardinality constraints, proving it to be strongly NP-hard, and devises a Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme (PTAS) for specific cases. The authors also propose a strategy to distribute revenue loss due to visibility constraints among products.",

      "quote": "We provide a characterization of the structure of the optimal assortments and present an efficient polynomial time algorithm for solving APV. To accomplish this, we introduce a novel function called the 'expanded revenue' of an assortment and establish its supermodularity. Our algorithm takes advantage of this structural property."
