    "description": "This paper proposes the use of GFlowNets to solve NP-hard combinatorial optimization (CO) problems by designing Markov decision processes (MDPs) that train conditional GFlowNets to sample from the solution space. The authors also develop efficient training techniques to handle long-range credit assignment. Their approach shows empirical advantages in finding high-quality solutions through extensive experiments on various CO tasks with synthetic and realistic data.",
