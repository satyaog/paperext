    "description": "This paper presents a study of 16 bright gravitationally-lensed galaxies at redshifts z‚âà1-3 selected from the CASSOWARY survey, focusing on the characterization of rest-frame UV nebular line emissions. It aims to understand the factors that regulate strong CIII] emission in these galaxies, particularly through the detailed study of CSWA-141, an extremely bright galaxy at z=1.42, which serves as an analog for reionization-era systems.",
