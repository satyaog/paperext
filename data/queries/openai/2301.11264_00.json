    "description": "This paper presents a study of 16 bright gravitationally-lensed galaxies at redshifts z≈1-3 selected from the CASSOWARY survey, focusing on the characterization of rest-frame UV nebular line emissions. It aims to understand the factors that regulate strong CIII] emission in these galaxies, particularly through the detailed study of CSWA-141, an extremely bright galaxy at z=1.42, which serves as an analog for reionization-era systems.",

Included in our sample is the z=1.42 galaxy CSWA-141, one of the brightest known reionization-era analogs at high redshift (g=20.5), with a large sSFR (31.2 Gyr−1 ) and an [OIII]+H equivalent width (EW [OIII]+H=730 Å) that is nearly identical to the average value expected at z≈7−8."
