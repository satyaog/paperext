    "description": "This study investigates how global signal topography in the human brain changes across different ages, utilizing a large sample of resting-state fMRI data. The findings indicate that global signal regression, commonly used for data denoising, affects functional connectivity differently based on age, which has crucial implications for lifespan network neuroscience.",

      "quote": "Using a large cross-sectional sample (601 subjects; 6-86 years old; 10 minute resting-state fMRI scan) of publicly available data (NKI-enhanced; Figure 1), we demonstrate distinct linear and quadratic associations between global signal topography and age for the first time."

In functional neuroimaging generally, and in human connectomics investigations utilizing resting state functional MRI (fMRI) specifically, this challenge has been met with the development of processing pipelines that mitigate artifacts known to obscure the underlying neural signal (2)."
