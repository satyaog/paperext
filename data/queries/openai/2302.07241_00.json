    "description": "This paper presents ConceptFusion, a technique for building open-set multimodal 3D maps by leveraging the capabilities of large foundation models like CLIP, DINO, and AudioCLIP. These maps can integrate features from various modalities such as text, image, audio, and clicks, making them queryable for arbitrary concepts in a zero-shot manner.",
