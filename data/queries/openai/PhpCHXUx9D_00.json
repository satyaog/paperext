    "description": "This paper explores a novel perspective on deep neural networks by conceptualizing them as traversing paths on a high-dimensional manifold of neural representations. It leverages advanced representational similarity metrics to analyze and visualize these paths, thereby offering new insights into the layer-wise transformations and overall geometry of neural network computations.",

In this spatial analogy, one layer of a neural network contributes a single step, and the composition of many steps transports representations along a path towards the desired target representation."
