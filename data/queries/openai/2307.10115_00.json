    "description": "This paper presents JWST and ALMA results for the lensing system SPT0418-47, which includes a strongly-lensed, dusty star-forming galaxy at redshift z = 4.225 and an associated multiply-imaged companion. It investigates the stellar masses, star formation rates, and structural properties of the galaxies involved using various imaging and data processing techniques.",
