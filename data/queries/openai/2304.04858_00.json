    "description": "This paper introduces Simulated annealing in EArly Layers (SEAL), a new iterative training method aimed at improving generalization in neural networks. SEAL applies gradient ascent to the early layers of the network during training, followed by gradient descent, without re-initializing the later layers. The paper demonstrates that SEAL outperforms the state-of-the-art later-layer-forgetting (LLF) method on tasks such as transfer learning and few-shot learning, using benchmarks like Tiny-ImageNet and several other datasets.",
