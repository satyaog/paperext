    "description": "The paper explores an alternative to reinforcement learning for learning from pairwise human preferences, treating it as a density estimation problem instead. The authors provide theoretical and empirical results, showing that training a reward function on pairwise preferences can effectively model an annotator's implicit preference distribution. They also discuss the effects of 'annotator misspecification' and its impact on learning models.",
