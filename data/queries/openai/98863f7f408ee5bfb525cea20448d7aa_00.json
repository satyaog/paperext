    "description": "This study explored the nature of repetitive and restricted behaviors and interests (RRBI) in autism, examining neuroanatomical correlates and clinical implications. It surveyed 792 participants, including autistic individuals, their relatives, and typically developing individuals, using clinical scales and MRI imaging. The study identified three main RRBI dimensions and their associated brain structures.",
