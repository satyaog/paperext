    "description": "This research paper investigates the associations between brain structure, functional connectivity, and behavior in autistic and non-autistic individuals using MRI data from multiple time points. The study utilizes advanced multimodal integration techniques to identify phenotypes associated with autism and explores how these phenotypes relate to behavioral measures.",

      "value": "Empirical Study",
      "justification": "The study involves data collection, analysis, and interpretation based on multimodal MRI, behavioral, and clinical data from participants.",
      "quote": "Neuroimaging analyses of brain structure and function in autism have typically been conducted in isolation, missing the sensitivity gains of linking data across modalities. Here we focus on the integration of structural and functional organisational properties of brain regions. We aim to identify novel brain-organisation phenotypes of autism."
