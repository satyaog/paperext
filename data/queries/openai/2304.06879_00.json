    "description": "This paper investigates the concept of performative prediction, where models influence the data they intend to predict. The authors propose a framework that relaxes the assumptions on the loss function by assuming the data distribution is Lipschitz continuous with respect to the model's predictions rather than its parameters. They introduce a resampling procedure modeling realistic distribution shifts and support their theory with empirical evidence using neural networks.",

We support our theory by showing that one can learn performatively stable classifiers with neural networks making predictions about real data that shift according to our proposed procedure."
