    "description": "The paper introduces LEAD, a novel optimizer for min-max games inspired by physical systems. The authors draw analogies between game optimization and particle dynamics to propose a second-order optimization method leveraging counter-rotational forces. They demonstrate the effectiveness of LEAD both theoretically and empirically on synthetic setups and large-scale tasks like GAN training.",
