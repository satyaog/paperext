    "description": "This paper investigates the connections between weighted finite automata (WFA), recurrent neural networks (RNN), and tensor networks. The authors demonstrate a novel low rank structure of the Hankel matrix using tensor train decomposition, and introduce a learning algorithm for linear second-order RNNs based on spectral learning. The algorithm shows equivalency between WFA and 2-RNN with linear activation functions, and validates its effectiveness on both synthetic and real-world datasets.",
