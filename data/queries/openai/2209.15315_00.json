    "description": "The paper proposes FusionRetro, a novel framework that utilizes context information for retrosynthetic planning. The approach incorporates context through three steps: encoding molecules into embeddings, aggregating information over routes, and readout to predict reactants. FusionRetro is the first to use in-context learning for retrosynthesis prediction and demonstrates improved performance over baseline methods.",
