    "description": "This paper presents a method for field data replication in simulation-based digital twins to match the performance of 5G wireless networks using a multi-objective optimization algorithm. The proposed approach integrates mixed-variable particle swarm optimization (PSO) with fairness adjustments (α-fairness) to balance key performance indicators (KPIs).",
