    "description": "The paper introduces an end-to-end training framework that integrates debiasing classifiers and counterfactual image generation to expose and mitigate the effects of spurious correlations in medical imaging classification tasks. It also proposes a novel metric called Spurious Correlation Latching Score (SCLS) to quantify classifier reliance on spurious correlations.",
