    "description": "This paper connects hierarchical variational inference (VI) methods for hierarchical models with generative flow networks (GFlowNets), bridging the two probabilistic frameworks. The authors demonstrate that in specific instances, VI methods and GFlowNets have equivalent learning objective gradients and discuss how differences between the two arise experimentally.",
