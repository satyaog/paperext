    "description": "This paper proposes GraphVF, a novel variational flow-based model designed for generating 3D molecules that specifically bind to target proteins, considering both geometrical and 2D skeletal constraints. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in binding affinity and other drug properties while enabling controllable generation of 3D molecules with specified sub-structures or drug properties.",
