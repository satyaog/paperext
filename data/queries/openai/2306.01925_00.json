    "description": "This paper focuses on enhancing the robustness and generalizability of reinforcement learning (RL) methods for traffic signal control. By integrating distributional and vanilla reinforcement learning using a policy ensemble (RGLight), it achieves superior performance under different scenarios such as varying traffic patterns and sensor failures. Extensive experiments show its effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art baselines.",
