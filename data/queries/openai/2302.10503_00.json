    "description": "This paper introduces Reusable Slotwise Mechanisms (RSM), a novel framework focused on modeling object dynamics through modular, reusable mechanisms and centralized contextual information. The authors argue that RSM enhances prediction accuracy and generalization in various tasks, from future frame prediction to visual question answering and action planning. Results show that RSM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both independent and identically distributed and out-of-distribution settings.",
