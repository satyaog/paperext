    "description": "This paper conducts a scoping review to explore age-related bias in artificial intelligence systems. It identifies how these systems encode, produce, or reinforce age-related bias and discusses the social, ethical, and legal implications. The review includes analysis based on a comprehensive search strategy, covering both academic and grey literature sources.",

What literature exists on the extent of age-related bias in AI systems?\n3. How do AI systems encode, produce, or reinforce age-related bias?\n4. What are the societal, legal, and ethical implications of age-related bias in AI systems?\n5. What is the state of knowledge on older people’s experiences of age related bias in AI systems?"
