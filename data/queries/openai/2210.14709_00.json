    "description": "This paper presents GLEM, an approach designed for learning on large text-attributed graphs by integrating graph structure and text using a variational Expectation-Maximization framework. The method aims to address scalability issues of combining large language models and graph neural networks by training these models separately and iteratively in an E-step and M-step.",
