    "description": "The paper performs a systematic study of the unintended memorization of image-specific information in self-supervised learning (SSL) models. The study defines this phenomenon as 'déjà vu memorization' and shows that given the trained model and a crop of a training image containing only the background, it is possible to infer the foreground object with high accuracy or even visually reconstruct it.",
