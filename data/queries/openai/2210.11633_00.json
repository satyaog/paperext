    "description": "This paper introduces a framework for automatically defining and learning deep generative models using problem-specific structure, particularly suited to tasks like sorting, constraint satisfaction, and matrix factorization. The proposed method combines diffusion models with graphical models, allowing for problem specifications that include relationships between variables and explicit representation of subcomputations.",
