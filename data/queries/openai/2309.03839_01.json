    "description": "This paper proposes the ORBIT (Offline Reinforcement Learning-Bootstrapped InTerface) method for training adaptive human-machine interfaces. It leverages a combination of offline reinforcement learning (RL) and online fine-tuning to map noisy, high-dimensional command signals from users to actions. The algorithm aims to optimize the interface for individual users using both offline pre-training and online human-in-the-loop RL. A user study showed that the ORBIT method improves user task performance over baseline directional interfaces for tasks like simulated navigation.",
