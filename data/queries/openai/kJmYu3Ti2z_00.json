    "description": "The paper investigates the relationship between the homophily principle and the performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on node classification tasks. It introduces the Contextual Stochastic Block Model for Homophily (CSBM-H) and metrics to quantify node distinguishability. The paper demonstrates that both intra-class and inter-class distinguishability are crucial for the effectiveness of GNNs, beyond the homophily levels, and proposes a classifier-based performance metric.",
