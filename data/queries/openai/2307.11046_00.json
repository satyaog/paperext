    "description": "The paper provides a detailed and formal definition of the Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) problem. It introduces a new mathematical language for analyzing and cataloging agents and defines a continual learning agent as one that carries out an implicit search process indefinitely. Further, it relates CRL to traditional views of multi-task reinforcement learning and continual supervised learning.",
