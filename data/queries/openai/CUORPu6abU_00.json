    "description": "This paper introduces a framework for offline model-based biological sequence design. It leverages a forward and backward mapping technique known as bidirectional learning while incorporating rich biophysical information from pre-trained language models and proposes a learning rate adaptation module named Adaptive-η. Experimental results across various DNA and protein sequence design tasks illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.",
