    "description": "The paper addresses the challenge of reliable specifications in AI systems by proposing a new family of specifications called neural representation as specification, which uses neural activation patterns (NAPs) to enhance the correctness and robustness of neural network predictions, potentially covering larger input regions compared to traditional methods. The effectiveness of NAPs is demonstrated through empirical studies on datasets like MNIST and CIFAR10.",
