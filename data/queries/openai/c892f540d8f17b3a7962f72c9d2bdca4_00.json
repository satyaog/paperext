    "description": "This paper investigates the differences in social behavior and inter-brain connectivity between dyads with typically developing (TD) participants and mixed dyads with both Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and TD participants. It employs kinematics and EEG-hyperscanning to analyze social imitation tasks.",
