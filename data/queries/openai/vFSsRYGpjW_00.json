    "description": "This paper proposes a distributional approach to Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) by parameterizing each edge flow through their quantile functions. This allows the model to handle stochasticity in the reward functions and produce more informative learning signals during training. The proposed method, quantile matching (QM), leads to improved performance on both deterministic and stochastic benchmarks.",
