    "description": "The paper proposes a new architecture named Block-State Transformer (BST), which integrates State Space Models (SSMs) for long-range contextualization and Block Transformer sublayers for short-term representation of sequences. The paper demonstrates that BST achieves better language modeling perplexity compared to similar Transformer-based architectures and can generalize to longer sequences while offering significant speedups.",

      "quote": "We show that our model outperforms similar Transformer-based architectures on language modeling perplexity and generalizes to longer sequences. In addition, the Block-State Transformer demonstrates more than tenfold increase in speed at the layer level compared to the Block-Recurrent Transformer when model parallelization is employed."
