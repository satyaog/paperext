    "description": "The paper investigates the fundamental question of sample complexity for model-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms in general-sum Markov games. The authors show that certain sample bounds are sufficient to obtain an approximate Markov perfect equilibrium. They explore the robustness of these equilibria to model approximations and provide explicit bounds on the approximation error.",
