    "description": "This research paper investigates the mismatch between evidence-based management recommendations and actual practice patterns for four common outpatient pediatric surgical conditions: dermoid cyst, epigastric hernia, hydrocele, and umbilical hernia. Through a rapid review of existing literature, it evaluates the evidence volume and discrepancies in clinical practice, highlighting the reliance on weak or outdated studies and common wisdom rather than genuine evidence.",
