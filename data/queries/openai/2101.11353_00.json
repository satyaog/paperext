    "description": "The paper introduces a new dropout mechanism called Variational Nested Dropout (VND). This method introduces Bayesian treatments to the nested dropout, enabling the learning of ordered importance of network parameters and representations from data. The paper demonstrates the application of VND in constructing Bayesian Nested Neural Networks (BN3) and enhancing generative models with ordered latent distributions.",

Results on variational auto-encoder with VND show it outperforms the baseline and related methods by a large margin in terms of image reconstruction and generation diversity."
