    "description": "This research paper provides a comprehensive survey and empirical comparison of current practices for predicting political party affiliation of Twitter users. It proposes new methods that are competitive with state-of-the-art techniques while requiring fewer computational resources. The study covers various data types such as tweet text, user relations, and interactions to compare their effectiveness for the task. Extensive experiments are conducted to measure accuracy, coverage, and cost to provide insights for both practical applications and further research.",
