    "description": "The paper proposes a novel method called Siamese Diffusion Trajectory Prediction (SiamDiff) for the pre-training of protein structure encoders. This method leverages multimodal diffusion processes to build correlated views of protein structures and sequences, maximizing the mutual information between these views to enhance protein representation learning.",
