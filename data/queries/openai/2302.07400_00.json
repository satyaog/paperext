    "description": "This paper introduces Denoising Diffusion Operators (DDOs), a framework for training diffusion models in function space. The approach involves a forward process that perturbs input functions gradually using a Gaussian process and a reverse process formulated by integrating a function-valued Langevin dynamic. The study addresses technical challenges in generalizing denoising score matching to infinite-dimensional function spaces and demonstrates the approach's applicability on various function-valued problems, including solutions to the Navier-Stokes equation, volcano InSAR, and MNIST-SDF datasets.",
