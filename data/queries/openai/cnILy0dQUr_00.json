    "description": "This paper introduces FusionRetro, a novel framework designed to utilize contextual information for retrosynthetic planning. By encoding molecules, aggregating information over reaction routes, and predicting reactants using an in-context learning approach, the model aims to improve the efficiency and accuracy of retrosynthetic predictions. The framework was benchmarked on a newly curated dataset, showcasing significant performance improvements over existing methods.",
