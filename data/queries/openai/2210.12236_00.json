    "description": "This paper explores the problem of performing Bayesian inference in probabilistic models where observations come with uncertainty, termed as 'uncertain evidence.' It examines different methods for interpreting such evidence and their implications for inference about latent variables. The study revisits older methods like Jeffrey's rule and virtual evidence, and evaluates a newer method called distributional evidence. Through experiments, the paper illustrates how different interpretations of uncertain evidence can lead to significantly different inference results.",
