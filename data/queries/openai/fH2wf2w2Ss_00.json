    "description": "This paper proposes a two-stage sampling procedure for unconditional image generation called Two-Stage Diffusion Models (2SDM). The first stage samples a semantic embedding of the image, and the second stage uses a conditional image diffusion model to generate the image based on this embedding. This methodology leverages the strengths of conditional diffusion models for the unconditional generation task, leading to superior image synthesis results.",
