    "description": "This paper provides an information theoretic dynamical systems perspective on the richness and ineffability of consciousness. It delves into how attractor dynamics in neural networks can explain both the rich detail and the difficulty of describing conscious experiences. The authors argue that richness corresponds to the amount of information in a conscious state, while ineffability corresponds to the information lost during processing. The paper also discusses intra-personal and inter-personal ineffability and offers a formal model to describe these phenomena.",
