    "description": "This paper presents a framework for pedestrian positioning that fuses data from IMUs, UWB, BLE, and WiFi signals through nonlinear factor graph optimization. The method does not require prior knowledge of the environment and integrates sensor data opportunistically. Novel factors for adaptive scaling and coarse loop closures are introduced to improve indoor positioning precision.",
