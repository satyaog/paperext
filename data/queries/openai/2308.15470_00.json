    "description": "This paper discusses how reinforcement learning agents can utilize pre-existing teacher policies to improve learning efficiency and task performance. Teacher policies are introduced as additional objectives in a multi-objective policy optimization setting. The study uses the Multi-Objective Maximum a Posteriori Policy Optimization (MO-MPO) algorithm to empirically show that teacher policies can speed up learning, especially in the absence of shaping rewards.",
