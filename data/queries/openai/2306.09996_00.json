    "description": "This paper explores various prompting techniques to improve zero- and few-shot Visual Question Answering (VQA) performance in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). It examines the role of question templates, image captions, chain-of-thought reasoning, and text-only few-shot examples in guiding VLMs to generate accurate answers, and proposes an LLM-guided pre-processing technique to enhance traditional VQA metrics.",
