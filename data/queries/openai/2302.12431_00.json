    "description": "The paper investigates alternative training dynamics for contrastive learning (CL) to understand the breadth of systems capable of implementing it. Through theoretical foundations and numerical experiments, it shows that CL can be implemented in biological or neuromorphic systems with temporally local updates, thus relaxing the constraints on training dynamics.",
