    "description": "This paper addresses the specific needs of Climate and Weather Modelling (CWM) using Machine Learning (ML) models for subgrid processes which are too small to be resolved by standard solution methods. It introduces a novel architecture aimed at addressing the particular requirements of CWM models, ensuring out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization and adherence to physical constraints. The proposed model integrates principles from PDE solution operators to improve prediction accuracy and meet these specialized requirements.",
