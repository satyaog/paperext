    "description": "The paper presents a machine learning-based approach to triage software updates by categorizing release notes into different types. It evaluates six classifiers and finds Logistic Regression to be the most effective. The study aims to streamline the triage process in Industry 4.0 ecosystems by providing a more automatic classification system for software updates.",
