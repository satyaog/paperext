    "description": "Inspired by human conscious planning, this paper proposes Skipper, a model-based reinforcement learning framework that utilizes spatio-temporal abstractions to improve generalization in novel situations. It automatically decomposes tasks into smaller subtasks, enabling sparse decision-making and focused computation on relevant environment parts. The framework demonstrates significant advantages in zero-shot generalization over state-of-the-art methods.",
