    "description": "This paper proposes a one-shot learning heuristic for mixed-integer programming (MIP) problems with special ordered sets of type 1 (SOS1). The method leverages solutions discovered within the branch-and-bound tree to construct a model with minimal overhead, aiming for high-quality solutions for recurring issues. It is evaluated on the locomotive assignment problem (LAP) and sets of MIPLIB instances that include SOS1 constraints and is shown to be effective when compared to state-of-the-art solvers like CPLEX, Gurobi, and SCIP.",
