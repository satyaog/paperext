    "description": "This paper addresses the challenges of developing foundation models in molecular machine learning due to the lack of large, hand-curated labeled datasets. It introduces seven novel datasets segmented into three categories: ToyMix, LargeMix, and UltraLarge, covering nearly 100 million molecules and over 3000 tasks, totaling over 13 billion labels of quantum and biological nature. It presents the Graphium graph machine learning library to facilitate molecular learning on these extensive datasets and provides baseline results to illustrate the potential of multi-task and multi-level learning.",
