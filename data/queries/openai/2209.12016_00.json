    "description": "This paper proposes and studies a new method to tackle the Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning Benchmark (URLB) from pixel-based inputs. By using unsupervised model-based RL for pre-training an agent and combining it with a task-aware fine-tuning strategy and a hybrid planner called Dyna-MPC, the authors achieve substantial improvement compared to previous baselines. The robustness of their approach is further validated on the Real-World RL benchmark.",

In particular, data-based and knowledge-based methods are more effective in the Walker and Quadruped domains, and random actions and competence-based are more effective in the Jaco domain. Detailed results for each method, which are available in Appendix D, also show that, in contrast with the findings in Sekar et al. (2020), many unsupervised RL approaches can be combined with world models for efficient exploration. This merit could be attributed to the way we carefully adapted these methods to effectively work with world models’. Details on the implementation are provided in Appendix B and the code is available on the project website."
