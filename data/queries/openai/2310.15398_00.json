    "description": "This paper investigates the assumptions and expectations surrounding fairness in Natural Language Generation (NLG) system behaviors. Through five case studies, the authors explore how NLG systems respond to identity-related language features (names, roles, locations, dialect, and style) and examine people's expectations of these system behaviors. The findings reveal tensions between invariance (uniform behavior across social groups) and adaptation (behavioral variation across social groups) and highlight the complexities involved in defining what constitutes “fair” or “good” NLG system behaviors.",

      "quote": "To illuminate tensions around invariance and adaptation, we conduct five case studies, in which we perturb different types of identity-related language features (names, roles, locations, dialect, and style) in NLG system inputs."
