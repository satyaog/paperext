    "description": "This paper proposes a Probabilistic Mutation Testing (PMT) framework for deep neural networks (DNNs), addressing the flakiness problem in current mutation testing (MT) methods caused by the stochastic nature of DNN training. The PMT framework aims to provide a more consistent decision-making process for identifying killed mutants. The study evaluates PMT using three models and multiple mutation operators, comparing its efficacy with traditional MT methods, and analyzing the trade-offs between approximation error and computational cost.",
