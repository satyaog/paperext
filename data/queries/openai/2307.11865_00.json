    "description": "This work explores the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to address problems at the intersection of spatial planning and natural language interfaces for navigation. The research focuses on enabling robots to follow complex, conversational instructions rather than simple imperative commands. The method, CARTIER, leverages large language models to interpret user queries and directs robots accordingly, demonstrating improved performance in interpreting such instructions compared to existing methods.",
