    "description": "This paper explores the potential for detecting the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB) at the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) using inverse-beta-decay (IBD) detection channels. It evaluates the DSNB flux predictions and various background sources and presents background suppression techniques like pulse shape discrimination (PSD) and triple coincidence (TC) cuts. The paper concludes with sensitivity studies, showing that JUNO can achieve significant DSNB detection or improve current DSNB flux limits.",
