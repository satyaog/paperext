    "description": "The paper investigates the potential of non-minimal Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) in explaining recent experimental tensions observed in long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments and the anomalous muon magnetic moment. The authors analyze data from the T2K and NOvA experiments and consider both isotropic and non-isotropic LIV effects to alleviate the observed discrepancies.",

For this purpose, the latest data from T2K and NOvA is analysed..."
