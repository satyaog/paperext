    "description": "This research paper introduces the generalized conditional flow matching (CFM) technique for continuous normalizing flows (CNFs). This method provides a simulation-free training procedure for CNFs, which is more stable and efficient than previous methods. Additionally, it presents a variant called optimal transport CFM (OT-CFM) which improves training stability and inference speed by approximating dynamic optimal transport. The paper also includes empirical evaluations on tasks such as single-cell dynamics, unsupervised image translation, and Schrödinger bridge inference.",
