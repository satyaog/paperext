The paper demonstrates that RISC offers state-of-the-art performance on several challenging reset-free RL environments.",

Specifically, we: (1) Investigate whether reverse curriculums are the best approach for reset-free RL; (2) Compare the performance of RISC to other reset-free methods on the EARL benchmark; (3) Evaluate the necessity of both; timeout-nonterminal bootstrapping and early switching for RISC with an ablation study."
