    "description": "This paper proposes Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement for the attention mechanism in Transformers by using implicitly parameterized convolutions and data-controlled gating. The authors introduce the Hyena hierarchy and evaluate its performance across various language modeling tasks, demonstrating superior speed and efficiency compared to existing models, including Transformers.",
