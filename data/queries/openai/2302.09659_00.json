    "description": "This paper focuses on predicting the evolution of pain and tiredness levels in cancer patients using an interpretable decision tree-based model called LightGBM. The study specifically addresses class imbalance using the oversampling technique of SMOTE. The dataset used consists of real-world patient data from 2013 to 2019, covering 20163 patients. The results indicate that previous symptom levels are key indicators for prediction.",
