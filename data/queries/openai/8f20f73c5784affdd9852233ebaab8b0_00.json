    "description": "This paper introduces Constant Memory Attentive Neural Processes (CMANPs), a variant of Neural Processes (NPs) that are designed to use constant memory. The main contributions include an efficient update operation for Cross Attention, a novel Constant Memory Attention Block (CMAB), and an autoregressive not-diagonal extension (CMANP-AND). The proposed models achieve state-of-the-art results on popular NP benchmarks while significantly improving memory efficiency.",
