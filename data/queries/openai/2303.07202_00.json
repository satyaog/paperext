    "description": "The paper presents an optimization model to assist in the planning of urban green spaces with a focus on parks. It discusses a two-stage decision process for optimizing the city-budget allocation to neighborhoods and the optimal location and design of parks within neighborhoods. The model includes considerations of equity and environmental justice, and it incorporates a clustering method to enhance computational efficiency. The methodology is applied to the city of Montreal as a case study.",
