    "description": "This paper proposes the use of Normalizing Flows (NFs) ensembles to estimate both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in dynamic systems. The authors introduce two methods, Nflows Out and Nflows Base, which utilize fixed dropout masks in order to form the ensembles. They further demonstrate the application of these methods in a range of experiments and benchmark datasets to validate the efficiency and uncertainty quantification.",
