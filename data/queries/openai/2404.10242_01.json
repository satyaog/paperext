    "description": "This paper explores the scaling properties of weakly supervised classifiers and self-supervised masked autoencoders (MAEs) when training on increasingly larger model backbones and microscopy datasets. The study finds that ViT-based MAEs outperform weakly supervised classifiers in various tasks and introduces a new channel-agnostic MAE architecture. The research demonstrates the effectiveness of these models by training on large-scale microscopy datasets and evaluating their performance in recalling known biological relationships.",
