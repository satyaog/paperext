    "description": "This paper investigates the use of Bayesian Persuasion in social media platforms to mitigate misinformation. By predicting the popularity and misinformation features of posts, platforms can strategically signal this information to users to alter their beliefs and discourage sharing misinformation. The study characterizes the optimal signaling scheme with imperfect predictions, formulates this as a linear program, and investigates the effects under a performative model where platform interventions influence future user behavior. The practical effectiveness of the approach is experimentally validated, showing significant reductions in misinformation.",

So while the platform, like the user, does not know with certainty the true state of the post, it can leverage this to build classification models to predict (with certain error rates) the post’s popularity and degree of misinformation."
