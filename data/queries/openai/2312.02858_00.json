    "description": "This paper explores the potential of causal representation learning to improve the interpretability and efficiency of machine learning-based climate model emulators. Specifically, it utilizes a method called Causal Discovery with Single-parent Decoding (CDSD) to infer causally-informed representations from climate datasets including emissions, temperature, and precipitation data.",
