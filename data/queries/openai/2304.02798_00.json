    "description": "The paper proposes a novel unsupervised source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) algorithm named Penalized Diversity (PD). PD enhances representational diversity through the use of separate feature extractors with distinct backbone architectures (DBA). Furthermore, the paper introduces the Weak Hypothesis Penalization (WHP) regularizer to mitigate the amplification of weak hypotheses. The effectiveness of PD is demonstrated empirically in natural, synthetic, and medical domains under different distributional shifts.",
