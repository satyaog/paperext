    "description": "This paper introduces Tree Cross Attention (TCA), a variant of Cross Attention designed for efficient inference by retrieving information from a logarithmic number of tokens. The authors also present ReTreever, an architecture leveraging TCA for token-efficient inference. They demonstrate the efficacy of TCA and ReTreever across several tasks, including classification and uncertainty regression, showing significant improvements in token efficiency compared to other models like Perceiver IO.",
