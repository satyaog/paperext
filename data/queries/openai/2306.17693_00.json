    "description": "This paper proposes and evaluates an algorithm based on Thompson sampling to improve exploration in Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets). The algorithm, termed Thompson sampling GFlowNets (TS-GFN), maintains an approximate posterior distribution over policies and samples trajectories from this posterior for training. The paper demonstrates that TS-GFN allows for improved exploration and faster convergence to the target distribution compared to previous exploration strategies used in GFlowNets.",
