    "description": "This paper explores the phenomenon called out-of-context meta-learning in large language models (LLMs). Through carefully designed synthetic experiments, the authors argue that LLMs internalize semantic content based on features indicating whether the content is likely to reduce future loss. This finding reveals an unexpected capability of LLMs, where they internalize broadly useful information and apply it in appropriate contexts, potentially affecting their future predictions and training.",
