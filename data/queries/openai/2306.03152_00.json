    "description": "This paper presents JWST observations that detect the 3.3μm PAH feature in a galaxy observed less than 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang. The study analyzes the spatial variations in PAH equivalent width and the ratio of PAH to total infrared luminosity across the galaxy, suggesting physical offsets between PAHs and large dust grains or wide variations in the local ultraviolet radiation field.",
