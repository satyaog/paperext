    "description": "This paper presents a geometric framework for interpreting the layer-by-layer operations of deep neural networks as spatial paths through high-dimensional representation space. The authors extend existing representational distance methods to compute geodesics, angles, and projections of representations. They use this framework to visualize and compare the paths taken by ResNet and VGG architectures on the CIFAR-10 dataset and discuss the implications for understanding network training and model comparisons.",
