    "description": "This paper introduces a novel method called Latent Unmixing, which applies band-pass filters to the latent space of a multi-dimensional convolutional neural network to disentangle overlapping signal components in noisy and undersampled volumetric images. The approach is demonstrated through various test cases including fluorescence lifetime microscopy and mode decomposition in optical fibers.",
