    "description": "This paper introduces the concept of Green Federated Learning (Green FL), focusing on optimizing Federated Learning (FL) parameters to minimize carbon emissions. It provides a data-driven evaluation of carbon emission profiles in FL tasks and offers guidelines for reducing the carbon footprint while maintaining competitive performance and training time.",
