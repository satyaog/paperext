    "description": "This work aims to improve bipedal robotic jumping abilities using a reinforcement learning framework. The developed system enables a bipedal robot, specifically Cassie, to perform robust and versatile dynamic jumps in real-world scenarios. The framework incorporates a multi-stage training scheme and a new policy structure that encodes the robot’s long-term and short-term input/output history. The policies trained in simulation are transferred directly to the hardware without further tuning, demonstrating capabilities such as standing long jumps, jumping onto elevated platforms, and multi-axes jumps.",
