    "description": "This paper proposes a novel real-time LiDAR intensity image-based SLAM system aimed at solving the geometric degeneracy problem in unstructured environments. It directly extracts feature points from intensity images for scan registration to estimate the robot's ego-movement and includes systems for loop closure detection and pose graph optimization.",

Both Fig. 6a and Fig. 7a are the maps generated by our algorithm. Fig. 6b and Fig. 7b then show the trajectories of different algorithms in the corresponding environments."
