    "description": "This research paper analyzes student assignment submission data from a functional programming course. It incorporates various features such as grades, activity time, time spent, and the number of static errors to identify four distinct student clusters: Quick-learning, Hardworking, Satisficing, and Struggling. The study aims to provide insights for both instructors and students to improve learning outcomes and teaching strategies.",
