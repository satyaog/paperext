    "description": "This paper investigates the factors contributing to performance differences between task-agnostic Continual Learning (CL) and multi-task learning (MTL) agents, focusing on data limitations, computational constraints, and high dimensional settings. It proposes a replay-based recurrent reinforcement learning (3RL) methodology for task-agnostic CL agents and demonstrates its effectiveness on synthetic tasks and the Meta-World benchmark.",
