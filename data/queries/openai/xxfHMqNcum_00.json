    "description": "This paper introduces a hybrid-grained feature interaction selection approach for deep sparse networks, targeting both feature field and feature value levels. The authors propose a decomposed space and a selection algorithm named OptFeature, which efficiently selects feature interactions from both levels. The method is validated on three large real-world benchmark datasets, demonstrating improvements in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and feasibility.",

We then develop a selection algorithm called OptFeature, which efficiently selects the feature interaction from both the feature field and the feature value simultaneously. Results from experiments on three large real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that OptFeature performs well in terms of accuracy and efficiency.\""
