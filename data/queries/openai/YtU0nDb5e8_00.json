    "description": "This paper introduces HAMPER, a method for detecting adversarial examples in machine learning models using halfspace-mass depth, a concept from statistics that offers center-outward ordering of data points. The paper demonstrates HAMPER's effectiveness across various benchmark datasets and compares it with state-of-the-art methods.",
