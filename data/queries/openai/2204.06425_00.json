    "description": "This paper studies the current state of machine-learned (ML) model documentation practices, particularly focusing on the adoption of model cards. It reveals gaps between the proposed documentation practices and real-world applications. Additionally, it introduces a tool named DocML to encourage better documentation practices among data scientists through nudging and traceability features.",
