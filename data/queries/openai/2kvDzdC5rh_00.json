    "description": "The paper presents IntentGPT, a novel approach for few-shot intent discovery using pre-trained large language models such as GPT-4. The proposed method includes an In-Context Prompt Generator, an Intent Predictor, and a Semantic Few-Shot Sampler to identify new user intents with minimal labeled data. Experiments show IntentGPT outperforms previous models on benchmarks like CLINC and BANKING.",
