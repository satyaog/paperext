    "description": "This paper introduces Ghost-on-the-Shell (G-SHELL), a new 3D mesh representation that can effectively parameterize both watertight and non-watertight meshes of varying topologies. The representation is grid-based, differentiable, and supports applications like multiview image reconstruction and generative modeling. The authors demonstrate that G-SHELL achieves state-of-the-art performance in non-watertight mesh reconstruction and generation tasks.",
