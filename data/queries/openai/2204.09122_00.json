    "description": "The paper proposes an alternative method for finding cutting planes in mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs) by reframing the problem as a continuous optimization problem. It uses neural networks to optimize a set of inequalities, referred to as the subadditive primal problem of the MILP. The paper introduces a two-step algorithm for this purpose and shows empirical gains over traditional methods.",
