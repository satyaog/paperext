    "description": "This research paper proposes a method named placing via picking (PvP) to autonomously collect real-world demonstrations for placing tasks in robotics. PvP reverses the grasping process to collect data in contact-constrained environments and trains a policy that generalizes to different object placement scenarios. The method employs tactile regrasping and compliant control for robot manipulations.",

Our approach yields robotic placing policies that outperform policies trained with kinesthetic teaching, both in terms of performance and data efficiency, while requiring no human supervision."
