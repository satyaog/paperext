    "description": "This paper introduces Crystal-GFN, a generative model designed to sample crystal structures based on desirable structural properties such as space group, composition, and lattice parameters. The model allows for the incorporation of physical and structural constraints and can use any available predictive model of a desired physico-chemical property as an objective function. Empirical evaluations demonstrated that Crystal-GFN is capable of sampling diverse crystals with low formation energy.",
