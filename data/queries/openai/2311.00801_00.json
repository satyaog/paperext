    "description": "This paper introduces GIST, a novel approach aimed at the efficient transfer of test sets for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). GIST enables the selection of appropriate test sets from existing ones to match desired properties such as neuron coverage or fault types without the need to regenerate them from scratch, saving computational resources and time. The paper empirically validates the feasibility of GIST using various DNN models, different properties, and datasets.",

      "quote": "To demonstrate GIST feasibility, we empirically investigate the potential for transferability of test sets using as the properties to transfer a fault type coverage property inspired by recent works of Aghababaeyan et al. [3] and a neuron coverage property based on k-Multi Section Neuron Coverage [39]."
