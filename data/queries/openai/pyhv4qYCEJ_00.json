    "description": "This paper focuses on the evaluation of Graph Self-Supervised Learning (GSSL) methods for molecular graph embeddings. The authors introduce a novel benchmarking suite called Molecular Graph Representation Evaluation (MolGraphEval) that profiles the molecular graph embeddings. Using MolGraphEval, they reveal significant inconsistencies between performance on existing downstream datasets and the nuanced probing tasks designed in their framework.",
