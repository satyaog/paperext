    "description": "The paper studies the loss landscapes of neural networks through the concept of mode connectivity, specifically focusing on whether minimizers relying on different mechanisms are connected via paths of low loss. The authors define mechanistic similarity based on shared invariances to input transformations and propose a method, connectivity-based fine-tuning (CBFT), to alter a model's prediction mechanisms. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets are conducted to validate their findings.",
