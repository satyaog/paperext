    "description": "The paper discusses the utility of the shortest reactional distance (SRD) metric in enhancing the biological interpretation of metabolite genome-wide association studies (mGWAS) results. The authors introduce PathQuant, an R package developed to compute SRD between gene-metabolite pairs using the KEGG database. The study shows how SRD annotation can prevent false negatives and aid in identifying biologically relevant interactions that might be missed by traditional statistical methods alone.",
