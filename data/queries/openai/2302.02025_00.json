    "description": "This paper proposes a self-supervised learning framework using self-attention and self-distillation to detect changes in Radio Access Networks (RANs) by monitoring Performance Measurement (PM) data. The framework aims to be scalable and generalizable, handling large datasets of time-varying metrics and adapting to various hardware setups with minimal expert intervention.",
