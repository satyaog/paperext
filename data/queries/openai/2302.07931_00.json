    "description": "The paper explores the integration of large language models (LMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) for the development of a semantically-aware robotic photographer. Using models like GPT-3 for generating photo descriptions and CLIP for identifying these descriptions in a video stream, the proposed ANSEL Photobot is capable of capturing contextually appropriate images at events without any fine-tuning. The study involves empirical evaluation where the photobot's performance is rated better than existing video summarization methods by human evaluators.",

      "quote": "In order to evaluate our method, we created robot-centric video recordings of three social events, and generated 9-image portfolios of each using both our method and a modern video summarization technique (CA-SUM, [9]). We then asked workers to perform pairwise comparisons between portfolios, ranking which they believe is more appropriate given the event description. Our method was consistently rated as more appropriate than those created by CA-SUM."
