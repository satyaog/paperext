    "description": "The paper presents OC-NMN, a modular neural network model designed for visual generative analogical reasoning. It introduces the Arith-MNIST dataset to evaluate the model's ability to generalize out-of-distribution by performing arithmetic operations on MNIST digits. Key innovations include leveraging object-centric inductive biases and a compositional data augmentation framework inspired by human imagination.",
