    "description": "This paper explores the use of reinforcement learning (RL) over text representations to identify high-value molecules. The authors analyze various design choices in text grammar and algorithm training, leading to the development of the ChemRLformer algorithm. Extensive experiments across 25 molecule design tasks demonstrate the algorithm's state-of-the-art performance in generating molecules with desired properties, including complex tasks like protein docking simulations.",
