    "description": "This paper introduces a method for predicting runtime errors in Python programs in a static setting where program execution is not possible. The authors present a dataset of competition-level Python programs annotated with runtime error information and propose an interpreter-inspired model for this task. Their approach demonstrates improved performance over baseline models and the ability to identify error locations without explicit supervision for fault localization.",
