    "description": "This paper provides an in-depth theoretical analysis of the quantile temporal-difference (QTD) learning algorithm used in distributional reinforcement learning. It proves the convergence of QTD and establishes its theoretical foundations, introduces related dynamic programming procedures (QDP), and explores the practical implications of this theoretical work.",
