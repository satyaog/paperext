    "description": "This work investigates the evolution of latent space when deep learning models are trained incrementally in non-stationary environments caused by virtual concept drift. The paper proposes a methodology for visualizing changes in latent representations and demonstrates how classes not targeted by concept drift can be negatively affected.",

Using the well-known MNIST dataset ... We first show that in a non-stationary environment, ... These results are supported by our final qualitative analysis of the latent representation evolution."
