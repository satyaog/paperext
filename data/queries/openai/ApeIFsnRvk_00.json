    "description": "This paper leverages information geometry tools to analyze the representation quality of Vision Transformers (ViTs) at both per-token and sequence levels. The analysis focuses on the spectral decay of the feature covariance matrix to identify the effective dimensionality and complexity of token representations. Findings suggest potential improvements in token pruning and merging techniques for more efficient transformer architectures.",
