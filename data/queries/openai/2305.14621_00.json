    "description": "This paper investigates the impact of object placement distribution on the performance of vision-based object detection models trained on synthetic data. By maintaining a consistent object placement distribution in the synthetic data, the authors demonstrate a substantial improvement in model performance on real-world data. They conducted experiments using the CARLA driving simulator for synthetic data generation and KITTI for real-world validation.",
