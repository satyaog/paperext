    "description": "This paper introduces DynGFN, a novel framework for Bayesian structure learning in dynamical systems, tailored for modeling posteriors over cyclic graphs. The method leverages Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) and RNA velocity techniques to better capture the uncertainty and cyclic nature of gene regulatory networks (GRNs). The authors propose a per-node factorization within DynGFN and highlight its efficacy through empirical evaluations on synthetic data and real single-cell RNA-velocity data.",
