    "description": "This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) as adaptable and generalizable policies for embodied visual tasks. The approach, named Large Language model Reinforcement Learning Policy (LLaRP), leverages reinforcement learning to teach a pre-trained frozen LLM to process text instructions and visual observations to generate actions within an environment. The study's key contributions include training the LLaRP model using reinforcement learning, evaluating its generalization abilities across unseen tasks, and introducing a new benchmark, Language Rearrangement, to facilitate further research. The results show that LLaRP achieves a success rate of 42% on 1000 unseen tasks, significantly outperforming various baselines.",
