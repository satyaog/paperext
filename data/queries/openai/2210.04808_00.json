    "description": "The paper addresses a variant of the personnel scheduling problem under unknown demand, incorporating employee satisfaction/preferences. It introduces a two-stage stochastic integer program with mixed-integer recourse to handle the endogenous and exogenous uncertainties in reserve staff scheduling. The approach is validated with empirical data from Los Angeles, showing improvements in social welfare and reductions in service cancellations.",
