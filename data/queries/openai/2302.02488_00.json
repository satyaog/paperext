    "description": "This paper proposes a Bayesian three-state coupled Markov switching model to analyze COVID-19 outbreaks based on hospital admissions in Quebec. The model accounts for disease states of absence, endemic, and outbreak, and incorporates factors like covariates and geographical spread. The paper demonstrates that mobility and the introduction of new variants are strong factors in outbreak emergence and persistence.",
