    "description": "The paper proposes a new framework called DEUP (Direct Epistemic Uncertainty Prediction) for estimating epistemic uncertainty, which accounts for both approximation and model uncertainty. The framework uses out-of-sample error estimates to train a secondary model that predicts the generalization error. It is particularly useful in interactive learning settings, such as active learning and reinforcement learning, to guide exploration efficiently by predicting uncertainty that informs where to gather new data points.",
