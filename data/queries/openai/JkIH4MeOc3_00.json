    "description": "The paper studies the problem of ensuring group fairness in the context of Reinforcement Learning (RL). It proposes algorithms for both tabular and high-dimensional Deep-RL settings that ensure fairness throughout the learning process and achieve sub-linear regret. The research highlights the challenges posed by fairness constraints and presents empirical results on various benchmarks.",
