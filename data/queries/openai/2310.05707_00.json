    "description": "The paper introduces a method to guide large language model (LLM) reasoning, particularly for math problems, using planning tokens. These tokens are embedded within the model to guide its reasoning steps, thereby increasing its reasoning capabilities without significantly increasing the number of parameters. Experiments on various math datasets show improved accuracy over standard fine-tuning methods.",
