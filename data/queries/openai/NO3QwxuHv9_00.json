    "description": "This paper proposes leveraging score-based generative models (SGMs) trained on large-scale general protein structures to perform protein conformational sampling. The proposed approach, named Score-based Enhanced Sampling (SENS), aims to complement traditional Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations by overcoming high-energy barriers in MD force fields. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SENS on several benchmark systems by comparing the results with long MD trajectories and state-of-the-art generative structure prediction models.",

This approach enables directly sampling of diverse conformation ensembles, thus effectively circumventing the high-energy barrier issue in traditional MD simulations. Moreover, SENS does not rely on any specific simulation data for training, and can be transferred to perform zero-shot conformational sampling by an amortized training. To assess the effectiveness of the SENS, we evaluate it on several benchmark systems, comparing the results with long MD simulations and state-of-the-art generative structure prediction models."
