    "description": "This paper introduces a novel posthoc interpretation method called Listenable Maps for Audio Classifiers (L-MAC), designed to generate listenable interpretations for pretrained audio classifiers. L-MAC uses a decoder to produce binary masks, highlighting relevant portions of the input audio. These masks are then used to create listenable audio outputs through a special loss function that maximizes the classifier decision's confidence on the masked-in audio while minimizing it on the masked-out portion. Experimental evaluations show that L-MAC outperforms other gradient and masking-based interpretation methods both quantitatively and qualitatively, with users preferring its interpretations on average.",

      "quote": "Quantitative evaluations on both in-domain and out-of-domain data demonstrate that L-MAC consistently produces more faithful interpretations than several gradient and masking-based methodologies. Furthermore, a user study confirms that, on average, users prefer the interpretations generated by the proposed technique."
