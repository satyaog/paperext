    "description": "The paper examines the interconnected axes of heterogeneity in machine learning systems, specifically focusing on values, culture and regulations, data composition, and resource and infrastructure capacity. It discusses how these axes influence each other and the overall trajectory of ML products, emphasizing the need for a holistic approach to ensure democratic and inclusive advancements. The paper critiques the current fragmented research approach and advocates for new socio-technical frameworks for sustainable ML development.",
