    "description": "The paper proposes a novel time-series transformer framework, Multi-resolution Time-Series Transformer (MTST), which incorporates multi-scale analysis for long-term forecasting. The framework employs a multi-branch architecture to model temporal patterns at different resolutions and employs relative positional encoding to better capture periodic components. Detailed experiments demonstrate that MTST outperforms state-of-the-art forecasting methods.",
