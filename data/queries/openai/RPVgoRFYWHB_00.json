    "description": "This paper proposes a new family of neural network specifications known as neural representation as specification. It introduces neural activation patterns (NAPs) that leverage the intrinsic properties of neural networks to define correctness and robustness. The paper presents methods for mining dominant NAPs and demonstrates their effectiveness using formal verification and experimental evaluations.",
