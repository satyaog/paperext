    "description": "This paper proposes a method to improve the compositional generalization of deep networks by using iterated learning combined with simplicial embeddings, which can approximately discretize representations. The method is shown to improve compositional generalization in vision tasks with well-understood latent factors and on real molecular graph prediction tasks where the latent structure is unknown.",

We find greatly improved performance with our discretization scheme, however, due to much-increased compressibility pressure."
