    "description": "This paper investigates parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) methods for the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) model in audio and speech downstream tasks. It compares various PETL methods, such as LoRA and adapters, across four benchmarks and conducts ablation studies to find the best configurations for these methods.",

        "quote": "The common modus operandi of fine-tuning large pre-trained Transformer models entails the adaptation of all their parameters (i.e., full fine-tuning). While achieving striking results on multiple tasks, this approach becomes unfeasible as the model size and the number of downstream tasks increase. For audio classification tasks, the Audio Spectrogram Transformer model shows impressive results."
