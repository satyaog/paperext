    "description": "This paper introduces an innovative framework, diffusion ensembles for capturing uncertainty (DECU), aimed at estimating epistemic uncertainty in large high-performing generative diffusion models, which generate high-dimensional images. The framework achieves computational efficiency by training ensembles within conditional networks using a static set of pre-trained parameters, significantly reducing the computational load. Pairwise-Distance Estimators (PaiDEs) are employed to capture epistemic uncertainty. Experiments validate the effectiveness of DECU on the Imagenet dataset, marking an advancement in detecting epistemic uncertainty in these models.",
