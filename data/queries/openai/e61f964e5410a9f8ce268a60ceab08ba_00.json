    "description": "This paper shows that both somata and distal apical dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons exhibit distinct unexpected event signals that evolve over days. These findings were obtained using two-photon calcium imaging to track the responses of individual somata and dendritic branches of layer 2/3 and layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the primary visual cortex of awake, behaving mice.",
