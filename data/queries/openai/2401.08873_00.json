    "description": "This paper provides technical comments and critical evaluation of the claims made in the target article 'Path integrals, particular kinds, and strange things' by Karl Friston et al. The authors address various conceptual and terminological issues emphasizing the need for precise semantics to improve clarity, rigor, and applicability in FEP-based formalisms.",
