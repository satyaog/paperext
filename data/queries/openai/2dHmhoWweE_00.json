    "description": "This paper proposes Lookbehind, a method to improve the efficiency of sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) by performing multiple ascent steps to find a worst-case perturbation with higher loss and using linear interpolation to refine the minimization step. It shows benefits across various tasks, including increased generalization performance, robustness against noisy weights, and improvements in lifelong learning settings.",

      "quote": "In this work, we present a novel optimization method, called Lookbehind, that leverages the benefits of multiple ascent steps and variance reduction to improve the efficiency of the maximization and minimization parts of equation 1. This leads to Lookbehind successfully reducing both loss and sharpness across small and large neighborhood sizes, achieving the best loss-sharpness trade-off."
