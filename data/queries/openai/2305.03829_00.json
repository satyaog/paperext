    "description": "This paper presents a Bayesian deep learning framework aimed at improving image-based precision medicine. By estimating the posterior distribution over factual and counterfactual outcomes for multiple treatments, the model assesses uncertainty for each treatment option and individual treatment effects (ITE). The model is trained and evaluated on a large multi-center dataset of MR brain images of multiple sclerosis patients.",
