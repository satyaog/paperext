    "description": "This research paper presents a deep learning architecture named CrossViViT designed to utilize spatio-temporal satellite data for highly accurate day-ahead Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) forecasting. The work includes developing a Multi-Quantile version of the model, which outputs a prediction interval for each time-step to measure forecasting uncertainty. The paper also introduces a testing scheme to evaluate model performance in varying cloud conditions, crucial for effective solar power integration into electrical grids.",
