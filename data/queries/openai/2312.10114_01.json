    "description": "The paper introduces FoMo-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed for evaluating forest-monitoring foundation models. It includes 15 diverse datasets featuring satellite, aerial, and inventory data, covering multiple geographical regions and various sensory modalities such as multispectral, red-green-blue, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and LiDAR data. The benchmark encompasses multiple forest-monitoring tasks, including classification, segmentation, and object detection. Additionally, the paper proposes FoMo-Net, a baseline foundation model capable of processing any combination of commonly used spectral bands in remote sensing.",
