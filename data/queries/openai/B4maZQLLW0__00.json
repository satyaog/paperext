    "description": "The paper addresses the varying degrees of coordination and environmental heterogeneity in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). It introduces HECOGrid, a suite of environments designed to empirically evaluate MARL approaches with quantitative control over coordination and heterogeneity levels. The paper also proposes the Stateful Active Facilitator (SAF), a learning approach that leverages centralized training and decentralized execution to improve performance in complex environments. The performance of SAF is compared with IPPO and MAPPO.",

We evaluate SAF and compare its performance against baselines IPPO and MAPPO on HECOGrid."
