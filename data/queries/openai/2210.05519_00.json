    "description": "This paper introduces EGO, an energy-based model for learning object-centric representations from visual scenes. The model uses vanilla attention blocks and gradient-based MCMC methods to infer object-centric latent variables. It is shown to be effective in segmentation accuracy and robust against distribution shifts, and can be used for controllable scene generation and manipulation.",
