    "description": "This paper proposes a data-driven, unsupervised method to improve Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection for textual data by aggregating layer-wise anomaly scores from neural network encoders. It challenges the common assumption that the last layer's output is always the best for OOD detection and demonstrates that leveraging information from all layers yields better results. The authors also introduce a new benchmark, MILTOOD-C, which includes classification tasks with a larger number of classes and multiple languages to reflect more realistic settings.",
