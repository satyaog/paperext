    "description": "This paper introduces a method called Importance-aware Co-Teaching (ICT) to address the out-of-distribution issue in offline model-based optimization problems. The method employs a two-step approach: pseudo-label-driven co-teaching for generating pseudo-labeled data and meta-learning-based sample reweighting for improving accuracy. ICT is proven to achieve state-of-the-art results in various design-bench tasks.",
