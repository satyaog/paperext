    "description": "This paper presents a novel manifold alignment method called MALI (Manifold alignment with label information) that learns a correspondence between two distinct domains. MALI leverages both the manifold structure of data and discrete class labels to guide the alignment. It recovers pairings and common representations, revealing related samples in both domains, and outperforms state-of-the-art manifold alignment methods across multiple datasets.",
