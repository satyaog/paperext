    "description": "The paper proposes the Ordered Memory architecture, which includes a new attention-based mechanism inspired by Ordered Neurons. The architecture uses a cumulative probability to control memory operations and introduces a new Gated Recursive Cell. The model shows strong performance on logical inference and ListOps tasks and achieves competitive results in the Stanford Sentiment Treebank tasks.",
