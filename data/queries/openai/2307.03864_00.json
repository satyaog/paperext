    "description": "This paper explores why Transformer-based methods perform so well in Reinforcement Learning (RL). It investigates whether the success of Transformers in RL is due to enhanced memory capabilities or better credit assignment for actions. Using configurable tasks designed to measure memory length and credit assignment length, the authors find that Transformers significantly improve the memory capabilities of RL algorithms but do not enhance long-term credit assignment. The study offers explanations for the effective use of Transformers in RL and opens avenues for future research in RL algorithm design.",
