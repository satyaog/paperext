    "description": "This study examines the performance of popular first-order optimizers for various classes of distributional shift under empirical risk minimization and invariant risk minimization. It addresses problems in image and text classification using DomainBed, WILDS, and Backgrounds Challenge as out-of-distribution datasets, with hyperparameters tuned across over 20,000 models.",
