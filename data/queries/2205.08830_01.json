    "description": "The paper discusses the potential of detecting the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB) at the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) through the inverse-beta-decay (IBD) detection channel on free protons. Using the latest DSNB flux predictions, the study evaluates background suppression and optimization techniques aiming to achieve significant detection sensitivity.",
