    "description": "The paper addresses the challenge of classifying out-of-distribution (OOD) samples with confidence using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It proposes a method to differentiate OOD sets based on generalization errors and introduces three efficient metrics (Softmax-based Entropy, Coverage Ratio, and Coverage Distance) to select the most effective OOD sets for training well-generalized, calibrated CNN models. The effectiveness is demonstrated across various image and audio classification tasks.",
