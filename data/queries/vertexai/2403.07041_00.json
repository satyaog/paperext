    "description": "The paper introduces GFACS, a neural-guided meta-heuristic algorithm for combinatorial optimization. It combines GFlowNets with ACO, enhancing ACO with an informed prior distribution of decision variables. GFACS outperforms baseline ACO algorithms in seven CO tasks and competes with problem-specific heuristics for vehicle routing problems.",
