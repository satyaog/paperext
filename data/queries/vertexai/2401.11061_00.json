    "description": "We introduce PhotoBot, a framework for fully automated photo acquisition based on an interplay between high-level human language guidance and a robot photographer.\\nWe propose to communicate photography suggestions to the user via reference images that are selected from a curated gallery. We leverage a visual language model (VLM) and an object detector to characterize the reference images via textual descriptions and then use a large language model\\n(LLM) to retrieve relevant reference images based on a user’s language query through text-based reasoning. To correspond the reference image and the observed scene, we exploit pretrained features from a vision transformer capable of capturing semantic similarity across marked appearance variations. Using these features, we compute pose adjustments for an RGB-D camera by solving a perspective-n-point (PnP) problem. We demonstrate our approach using a manipulator equipped with a wrist camera. Our user studies show that photos taken by PhotoBot are often more aesthetically pleasing than those taken by users themselves, as measured by human feedback. We also show that PhotoBot can generalize to other reference sources such as paintings.",

The authors conduct experiments and user studies to evaluate its effectiveness in capturing aesthetically pleasing photos, addressing user prompts, and aligning with reference images\\' layouts and compositions. This hands-on approach and focus on practical implementation and evaluation classify the research as empirical.",
