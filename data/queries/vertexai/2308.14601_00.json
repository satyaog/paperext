    "description": "The paper focuses on mitigating popularity bias in music recommender systems, particularly in graph neural network (GNNs). The authors propose a domain-aware, individual fairness-based approach to address the issue. They argue that their approach, by considering the similarity of music tracks, leads to a more relevant discovery of niche content. The authors demonstrate their approach on two music recommendation tasks, Automatic Playlist Continuation and Weekly Discovery, and show that it outperforms existing fairness benchmarks in terms of both performance and the recommendation of lesser-known content.",
