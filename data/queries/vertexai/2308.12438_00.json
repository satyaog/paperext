    "description": "This paper presents an empirical study on Stack Overflow to uncover and understand the challenges practitioners faced when deploying Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) systems. The study analyzes Stack Overflow posts related to DRL deployment on different platforms: server/cloud, mobile/embedded system, browser, and game engine. The authors identified 357 relevant posts and built a taxonomy of 31 unique challenges across 11 categories. The results show that RL environment-related challenges are the most popular, while communication-related challenges are the most difficult. The authors also found that DRL deployment is more difficult than other DRL issues. The study provides insights for practitioners, researchers, and framework developers to improve DRL system deployment.",
