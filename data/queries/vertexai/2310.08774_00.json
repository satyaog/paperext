    "description": "The paper presents PhyloGFN, a generative flow network (GFlowNets) model for phylogenetic inference. It tackles parsimony-based and Bayesian phylogenetic inference by exploring and sampling from the multimodal posterior distribution over tree topologies and evolutionary distances. PhyloGFN is shown to be competitive with prior works in marginal likelihood estimation and achieves a closer fit to the target distribution than state-of-the-art variational inference methods.",
