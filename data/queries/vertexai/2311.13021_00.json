    "description": "The paper presents a preliminary study investigating changes in human handover behavior when transferring objects with varying risk levels, using a high-resolution touch sensor. The study involved participants handing over a safe object (empty cup) and a hazardous object (full cup) while being monitored for tactile behavior changes. The authors found a distinct difference in handover duration between the full and empty cup, with the former being slower and exhibiting altered tactile behavior due to the risk factor. The study emphasizes the need for a deeper understanding of tactile factors in risky handovers to enhance safety in human-robot interactions.",
