    "description": "This research paper explores the potential of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) as an explanation for recent anomalies observed in neutrino oscillation experiments, specifically focusing on data from the T2K and NOvA experiments. The authors investigate both isotropic and non-isotropic LIV effects in various dimensions (D=4, 5, 6) to assess their impact on neutrino oscillation parameters and their potential to reconcile tensions between experimental results. The study also examines the implications of LIV for the anomalous muon magnetic moment.",
