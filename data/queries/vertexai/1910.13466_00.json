    "description": "The paper introduces Ordered Memory (OM), a novel neural network architecture for natural language processing tasks that require compositional understanding. OM maintains a stack-like memory structure, similar to a shift-reduce parser, to recursively compose representations of sub-trees from input sequences. The model is evaluated on logical inference (Bowman et al., 2015) and ListOps (Nangia and Bowman, 2018) tasks, demonstrating strong performance and the ability to induce latent tree structures. Additionally, the model achieves competitive results on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST). Notably, the paper introduces a new Gated Recursive Cell inspired by the Transformer architecture, contributing to the model\\'s effectiveness in capturing compositional relationships.",
