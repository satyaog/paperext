    "description": "The paper investigates the use of fMRI for studying the human spinal cord. The study compares axial and sagittal scanning planes in terms of data quality and reproducibility. The authors conclude that axial scanning is advantageous for mitigating physiological noise and minimizing inter-subject variance. The study utilized the Spinal Cord Toolbox (SCT) for data analysis.",

      "quote": "This study was aimed at systematically verify whether sagittal scanning in scfMRI using EPI readout is a viable alternative to the more common axial scanning, and at optimizing a pipeline for EPI-based scfMRI data analysis, based on Spinal Cord Toolbox (SCT)."
