    "description": "This paper explores the combination of metaheuristics and neural network solvers for the Transit Network Design Problem (NDP). Specifically, it proposes a hybrid algorithm that integrates a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model into a Bee Colony Optimization (BCO) metaheuristic, demonstrating significant performance improvements over both the stand-alone learned policy and the original BCO algorithm.",

We perform a set of ablations to study the impact of each component of the modified algorithm."
