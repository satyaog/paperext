    "description": "This paper proposes an active forgetting mechanism during the pretraining of language models to improve their adaptability to new languages. By regularly resetting the embedding layer during pretraining, the authors encourage the model to better learn new embeddings, similar to a meta-learning effect. Experiments demonstrate faster convergence and better performance in low-data scenarios, especially for languages distant from English.",
