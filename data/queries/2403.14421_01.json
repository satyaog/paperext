    "description": "This paper develops a differentially private retrieval-augmented generation algorithm, DP-RDM, capable of generating high-quality image samples while providing provable privacy guarantees. It assumes access to a text-to-image diffusion model trained on a small amount of public data and designs a DP retrieval mechanism to augment the text prompt with samples retrieved from a private dataset, requiring no fine-tuning on the private data.",

      "quote": "We evaluate our DP-RDM on three datasets—CIFAR-10, MS-COCO and Shutterstock, a privately licensed dataset of 239M image-captions pairs—and show that it can effectively adapt to these datasets privately with minor loss in generation quality."
