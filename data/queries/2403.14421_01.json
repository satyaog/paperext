    "description": "This paper develops a differentially private retrieval-augmented generation algorithm, DP-RDM, capable of generating high-quality image samples while providing provable privacy guarantees. It assumes access to a text-to-image diffusion model trained on a small amount of public data and designs a DP retrieval mechanism to augment the text prompt with samples retrieved from a private dataset, requiring no fine-tuning on the private data.",
