    "description": "The paper presents a method to ensure the energy sufficiency of a robot during long-term missions in unknown and unstructured environments using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). This framework provides energy sufficiency guarantees by overlaying an energy-aware layer on top of any path planner. The method was validated both in simulations and with physical robots equipped with full localization and mapping stacks.",
