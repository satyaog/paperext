    "description": "This research proposes a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm named CAMMARL. The main idea is to model the actions of other agents as conformal prediction sets, which provide high-probability guarantees of containing the true actions. The algorithm aims to optimize an autonomous agent’s decision-making capabilities in multi-agent environments. The performance of CAMMARL is demonstrated through various experiments in cooperative multi-agent tasks.",
