    "description": "This research paper introduces the Gemini family of multimodal models with Ultra, Pro, and Nano variants. These models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in various multimodal tasks, including image, audio, video, and text understanding. Evaluations indicate significant advances in 30 out of 32 benchmarks examined.",
