    "description": "This paper investigates the occurrence and nature of self-admitted technical debt (SATD) in machine learning (ML) software. By analyzing 318 open-source ML projects across five domains and comparing them with 318 non-ML projects, it aims to understand the prevalence, composition, and evolution of SATD in ML code.",
