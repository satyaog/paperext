    "description": "This paper proposes an active forgetting mechanism during the pretraining of pretrained language models (PLMs) to improve their ability to adapt quickly to new languages. By periodically resetting the embedding layer, the model enhances its ability to learn new embeddings rapidly, similar to a meta-learning effect. Experiments demonstrate faster convergence and improved performance, especially for low-resource and linguistically distant languages.",

      "quote": "Experiments with RoBERTa show that models pretrained with our forgetting mechanism not only demonstrate faster convergence during language adaptation, but also outperform standard ones in a low-data regime, particularly for languages that are distant from English."
