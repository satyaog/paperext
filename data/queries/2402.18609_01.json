    "description": "This paper presents ICE-SEARCH, a novel methodology that integrates language models (LMs) with evolutionary algorithms for feature selection (FS) tasks in Medical Predictive Analytics (MPA). The approach leverages the adaptive capabilities of LMs to improve FS, particularly in medical datasets for stroke, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes predictions.",
