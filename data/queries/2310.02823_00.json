    "description": "The paper introduces Logit-scaling GFlowNets (Logit-GFN), a new architectural design aimed at improving the training efficiency and stability of temperature-conditional GFlowNets. The method reduces the numerical challenges arising from different gradient profiles at various temperatures by using a learned function of temperature to scale the logits of the policy directly. Empirical results show enhanced generalization and mode discovery in various biological and chemical tasks using this approach.",
