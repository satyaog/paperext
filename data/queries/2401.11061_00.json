    "description": "This paper introduces PhotoBot, a framework for automating photo acquisition through an interplay of human language guidance and robotic photography. The system uses a combination of visual language models (VLM), object detectors, and large language models (LLM) to suggest reference photographs to users based on their language queries and to adjust the camera view for optimal photo composition.",

      "value": "Empirical Study",

      "quote": "We demonstrate our approach using a manipulator equipped with a wrist camera. Our user studies show that photos taken by PhotoBot are often more aesthetically pleasing than those taken by users themselves, as measured by human feedback."
