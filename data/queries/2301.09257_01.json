    "description": "This paper proposes a novel real-time LiDAR intensity image-based SLAM system aimed at solving the geometric degeneracy problem in unstructured environments. It directly extracts feature points from intensity images for scan registration to estimate the robot's ego-movement and includes systems for loop closure detection and pose graph optimization.",
