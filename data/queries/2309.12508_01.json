    "description": "This paper presents DJINN, a diffusion based method of generating traffic scenarios for autonomous vehicles. DJINN diffuses trajectories of all agents conditioned on a flexible set of state observations and reports state-of-the-art performance on joint trajectory metrics. The flexibility of DJINN allows it to perform test-time sampling from various conditional distributions, including goal-based sampling, behavior-class sampling, and scenario editing.",
