    "description": "This paper explores the use of Sparse Tensor Neural Networks to reduce memory usage and improve the performance of deep learning models for 3D Ultrasound Localization Microscopy (ULM). Several approaches to efficiently convert ultrasound data into a sparse format are examined, along with the impacts on performance and memory requirements. The study shows that sparse formulations can significantly reduce memory costs and enable effective scaling of ULM from 2D to 3D, even with high concentrations of microbubbles.",
