    "description": "This paper presents an optimization method with adjustable computation time for scheduling problems involving machines and transporters across multiple stages. The proposed approach involves discretizing time, clustering jobs, and using integer linear programming to create schedules that minimize both time and energy consumption. The method is applied to a robotic water sampling project.",
